WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:09.030
So for our first model let's begin with something pretty straightforward like a couch just a sofa.

00:09.030 --> 00:17.460
So I'm going to go here into Google and just type old couch and let's see if we can find something that's

00:17.470 --> 00:21.040
just kind of run down kind of like this.

00:21.130 --> 00:25.480
That's not bad but I'm not fond of these arms right here.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.620
This is a little too much I think.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.950
But this is kind of what I'm looking for something really ugly like this.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.530
This actually looks just about right.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.280
Oh yeah.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.440
That is truly awful.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.640
So let's go ahead and grab that.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.930
So I've got my folder here.

00:49.940 --> 00:58.170
I've got a file folder for reference images so I'll just call this sofa.

00:58.180 --> 00:58.940
So there we go.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.710
So that's the one we're going to do.

01:00.710 --> 01:01.400
Perfect.

01:01.610 --> 01:03.120
All right.

01:03.220 --> 01:04.500
That was easy.

01:04.500 --> 01:10.900
What I usually do when I'm trying to model something like this is I'll create a new window right over

01:10.900 --> 01:19.600
here just pull this tab down to create a new window and let's change it to a movie image editor and

01:19.600 --> 01:28.240
in the movie image editor will click open and I'll go find that file that I just downloaded in reference

01:28.240 --> 01:30.110
images and there it is.

01:30.130 --> 01:35.470
Now if you can't find it you can always click on this little button right here and that'll give you

01:35.680 --> 01:37.530
a preview of each of the images.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.320
But this is the one I want.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.150
Open image.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.160
And there we go.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.600
So now I have it kind of here in front of me as I work.

01:46.600 --> 01:52.630
Once again I think reference images are hugely important for anything you're doing.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.350
All right so I'll go to a new layer right down here and begin fresh.

01:59.440 --> 02:07.360
I think first what I'll do is maybe work on this piece down here right down here so just to kind of

02:07.360 --> 02:10.780
establish the size of it right here.

02:10.780 --> 02:17.320
So go to the Create tab click on cube and let's start getting this in place.

02:17.320 --> 02:22.540
So I'm thinking that this will be about like maybe like this.

02:22.540 --> 02:30.790
And I'm just hitting X and Y and then S and x to scale a bit.

02:30.990 --> 02:38.280
Just trying to get a general sense of what this is going to look like kind of how big it's going to

02:38.280 --> 02:38.450
be.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.380
We can always adjust the proportions as we go.

02:41.640 --> 02:50.820
But it's good to get it just generally in the right size and shape maybe a little bit more out in the

02:50.820 --> 02:54.670
x something like that.

02:55.070 --> 02:55.800
All right.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.800
So now that we've got that let's start working on the arms here.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.410
Once again I'm going to create a new cube.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.870
Just click cube.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.440
I'll scale it down a bit.

03:08.610 --> 03:19.200
And I'll move to one side and it's scaled in the y s y and try and get this one in place as well.

03:19.200 --> 03:26.790
Now I'm going to hit the three key on the number pad and that will pull me around to the right camera

03:26.820 --> 03:31.660
and then I'll hit the five key and that gives me the orthographic view.

03:32.040 --> 03:41.190
And let's just move this and place maybe a little bit narrower something like this.

03:41.190 --> 03:46.160
So let's say it's going to be above that right about like that.

03:46.160 --> 03:53.200
I'm looking at this here so here's this piece something like that it may need to come up just a little

03:53.200 --> 03:53.990
bit more.

03:54.160 --> 03:54.850
Something like that.

03:54.850 --> 03:59.610
So I'm just trying to work out the basic details here.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.020
Let's grab this face.

04:03.070 --> 04:07.730
Hit that three key and pull that down to right about here.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.840
Yeah I think that's going to work out.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.360
I may want to pull this up just a little bit more.

04:13.430 --> 04:20.220
So it's just a matter of trying to get it as close as you can to your reference image at this point.

04:20.840 --> 04:28.790
So now I can maybe hit the one key and go back to object mode with the tab key and hit s and X and then

04:28.790 --> 04:33.670
scale this out just a bit like that.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.040
All right so I'll spin it around.

04:36.050 --> 04:39.580
And so we're beginning to get that basic shape.

04:39.610 --> 04:44.060
I we hit the five key to go back to perspective mode.

04:44.330 --> 04:47.750
Maybe I'll pull these up just a little bit like this.

04:47.750 --> 04:55.700
All right so grab this one hit that seven key five key to go to orthographic view and I'm going to duplicate

04:55.700 --> 04:57.890
this arm and bring it over to the other side.

04:57.890 --> 05:05.510
So under press shift d to duplicate and then I can hit the Y key and now when I move it it's going to

05:05.750 --> 05:16.170
constrain that object to the y axis and really go all right now we need to work on that back part now.

05:16.220 --> 05:21.290
It's kind of hard to see what's going on back there but I think what I'll do is I'll just grab this

05:21.400 --> 05:26.930
and press shift d to duplicate it and hit enter to keep it where it is and then I'm just going to move

05:26.930 --> 05:30.170
it back and rotate it around the y axis.

05:30.170 --> 05:36.730
Now if I hit the in key A can see up here the rotate fields here.

05:36.860 --> 05:42.200
If I hit r n y to rotate around the y axis here are y.

05:42.200 --> 05:50.860
Now I can rotate around that axis and I can see the degrees changing up there in the y rotation field

05:50.870 --> 05:53.280
so I'm going to bring it up to around.

05:53.300 --> 06:00.840
I don't know around negative 90 here let's say and I'll type in the negative 90.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.450
So there we go.

06:02.930 --> 06:12.810
And let me hit that one key and five key and I'm going to bring this up put it back here a bit like

06:12.870 --> 06:13.550
that.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.900
I want to scale it out in the y s y.

06:21.860 --> 06:30.940
And now if I tab into edit mode and grab that face I'm going to bring it down to where the top of the

06:30.940 --> 06:31.950
arm is.

06:32.050 --> 06:35.170
Because I think this top part kind of angle is back.

06:35.200 --> 06:43.770
So if I get e to extrude and pull up a bit and then maybe lean it back just like that and even rotate

06:43.770 --> 06:45.520
it a smidge.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.800
Maybe that'll work.

06:46.820 --> 06:47.630
Let's try that

06:51.580 --> 06:53.200
something like this.

06:53.280 --> 06:53.790
OK.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.600
So we're beginning to get the shape of the couch there.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.000
We need pillows right.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.260
We need pillows here so it looks to me it still looks to me like it's a little bit not quite long enough

07:08.260 --> 07:18.100
so I'm going to select all these here and press S and Y and scale just a bit that's looking a little

07:18.100 --> 07:20.290
bit better I think.

07:20.290 --> 07:27.190
Now I'll hit the A key to de-select and this time instead of going to the Create tab I'll press shift

07:27.250 --> 07:32.310
a and I'll choose Nash and cube.

07:32.950 --> 07:39.650
Now going to bring this up and this is going to be the first cushion I'll press S and Z and scale it

07:39.730 --> 07:49.850
down a bit and let's bring this right down here and if I go to the top view and I'm going hit the Z

07:49.850 --> 07:58.660
key to go to wireframe and I want to scale this out in the Y and the X but not the Z I want to keep

07:58.660 --> 08:05.410
it the same thickness but I want to scale it out in the y in the X so to do that I can press S for scale

08:05.410 --> 08:15.790
and then I can press shift and Z and that will cancel out the Z axis so I'm only scaling in the Y on

08:15.790 --> 08:16.710
the X.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.200
So maybe something like this.

08:19.360 --> 08:27.650
Now S X and we go right now and hit the five key again.

08:27.650 --> 08:35.090
Now see if we can get these in place I'll press shift D and y move these over here.

08:35.210 --> 08:44.830
Looks like I need to bring him in just a bit s y scale in s y scale in just a little bit.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.280
Not duplicate.

08:47.340 --> 08:51.830
And why bring that over here OK.

08:53.810 --> 08:56.060
So that is the basic shape.

08:56.060 --> 08:59.440
Now we need these pillows up here.

09:00.450 --> 09:07.610
So I think what I'll do is I'll just grab one of these again like this and I'll duplicate it.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.380
Press Enter now I'll just bring it up.

09:11.540 --> 09:19.600
Rotated around the y r y and then maybe scale this in the z axis.

09:19.600 --> 09:30.430
But now that I've angled this if I hit Z if I scale in the z axis with s and Z it's going to scale not

09:30.490 --> 09:32.590
quite the way I want it to.

09:32.590 --> 09:37.670
I want it to scale in line with the object not straight up and down.

09:37.810 --> 09:45.260
So I can always switch from global transformation orientation to local right here.

09:45.320 --> 09:52.210
Now you can also do that by pressing alt space and then you get this orientation menu and you can switch

09:52.210 --> 09:54.690
from global to local here as well.

09:54.820 --> 10:03.230
But if you notice when I did that the transformation gizmo here now is aligned to the object.

10:03.250 --> 10:10.280
So now I can switch to scale and I can scale this in a bit something like that.

10:11.510 --> 10:20.560
Now I want to move it back straight back in to do that I'll switch back to Global so alt space global.

10:21.260 --> 10:30.560
And one thing I've done here is I've added some extra keyboard shortcuts so that I can switch from the

10:30.560 --> 10:36.610
move gizmo to the rotate gizmo to the scale gizmo here very easily.

10:36.610 --> 10:45.170
So the way I have it set up is I press control alt left arrow to go to the move manipulator and then

10:45.170 --> 10:52.640
I press control alt down arrow to go to the rotate manipulator and then control alt right arrow to go

10:52.640 --> 10:54.080
to the scale.

10:54.200 --> 11:03.410
So it's you may see me doing that quite a bit now the way you change this the way you set up a new keyboard

11:03.440 --> 11:14.100
shortcut for yourself is up here under file and user preferences and you can go into here and go into

11:14.120 --> 11:19.170
input go to 3D view 3D view global.

11:19.400 --> 11:24.830
And then if you scroll all the way down you'll see you've got this add new.

11:25.250 --> 11:30.490
And if you click add noom which you can do is create new shortcuts.

11:30.500 --> 11:38.570
You can see here that I've done that three times I clicked add new and then I put this view 3D dot enable

11:38.600 --> 11:48.800
underscore manipulator and I chose the left arrow control and alt right and then I did the same thing

11:48.800 --> 11:51.780
here with the down arrow control and all.

11:51.800 --> 11:59.090
Now each one of these does something right here you can see Andrew translate I've got translate checked

11:59.090 --> 12:00.290
here.

12:00.500 --> 12:08.570
I've got rotate checked here and I've got scale checked here so you can create your own keyboard shortcut

12:08.840 --> 12:12.790
to switch between one manipulator or another.

12:12.950 --> 12:20.240
Because Blendr doesn't really give you by default the ability to switch the manipulator using a keyboard

12:20.240 --> 12:21.190
shortcut.

12:21.200 --> 12:21.930
All right.

12:21.950 --> 12:28.100
McLaws this down and let's keep going with our our couch here.

12:28.140 --> 12:35.780
I think I'll rotate that just a little bit like this and it doesn't look like it goes up quite that

12:35.780 --> 12:40.070
high so maybe I will scale it a little bit.

12:42.370 --> 12:46.850
Here down just a little bit like that and maybe a little bit.

12:46.890 --> 12:48.850
And I don't think it needs to be quite that thick.

12:48.850 --> 12:51.400
There we go something like that.

12:51.400 --> 12:59.710
All right I'll go ahead and duplicate this all go back to the move manipulator press shift D and I'll

12:59.710 --> 13:06.340
hit enter and then I'll just drag this over to here and once again it looks like I've got it a little

13:06.340 --> 13:08.940
bit askew there now doesn't it.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.370
Let me press R and Z.

13:11.830 --> 13:20.620
And sure enough I've got it kind of catty Wampus me see if I can fix this one a bit here too.

13:20.890 --> 13:26.650
And we go and I'll zero out the X as well as we go.

13:27.260 --> 13:32.030
All right so now that I've got the basic shape here I think one last thing I want to do is put some

13:32.360 --> 13:34.460
feet on here.

13:34.700 --> 13:39.390
I think what I'll do is just create a couple of cylinders.

13:39.530 --> 13:44.730
I'll come up here to the Create tab and I'll click on cylinder and that'll pop that into here.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.330
I don't think I need 32.

13:46.340 --> 13:56.390
Maybe I'll just do 12 sides and for the can't fill you can choose either in gun or triangle fan or nothing

13:56.390 --> 14:06.220
and I think I just want nothing there so scale that down hit the three key and the 5 key to go to orthographic

14:06.230 --> 14:11.600
view and I'll just move this right over here something like that.

14:11.840 --> 14:19.580
That still looks a little too high so I'm going to hit the Z key and then two border select this whole

14:19.670 --> 14:25.610
group of objects I'm going to test the B key and click and drag and that will just border select all

14:25.610 --> 14:26.860
of these.

14:26.870 --> 14:32.010
Now I can just move them down and we go now for this.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.310
I'll go ahead and duplicate it.

14:34.330 --> 14:39.240
I'll go to the top view and move it forward a bit.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.680
I like this maybe it can be right about here.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.830
I like that.

14:46.830 --> 14:53.220
And then I'll duplicate and press Y and then move this up to here.

14:55.440 --> 15:06.640
And then I select them both and press shift D and then X and we move these back here like that we go.

15:07.280 --> 15:16.060
All right so what I'm going to do is begin selecting some of these areas and maybe using the subdivision

15:16.180 --> 15:23.270
service modifier I'll start giving these a little bit of a curve so I can come over here to the modifiers

15:23.270 --> 15:30.590
panel and if I click add a modifier and subdivision surface it kind of collapses into that.

15:30.800 --> 15:36.560
And that's kind of ugly but that's OK if I hit the tab key you can see there's the original mesh of

15:36.560 --> 15:37.530
the object.

15:37.550 --> 15:44.600
So what I can do is press control are to add an edge loop and I'm going to bring it over here and I'll

15:44.600 --> 15:49.180
scroll the mouse wheel once and click and then click again.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.030
And that gives us that.

15:52.070 --> 15:55.330
And I'll then do the same thing vertically.

15:55.460 --> 16:02.300
But this time I'll take these two edges and I'll press S and Y and I'll scale them out like this.

16:03.550 --> 16:06.100
And maybe I'll press alt and click.

16:06.100 --> 16:13.900
So that will select that whole edge loop all the way around and I'll press alt and shift and click and

16:13.900 --> 16:19.140
you can see if I hit the Z key that selected those edges all the way around.

16:19.180 --> 16:24.220
So now I'm going to press S and Z and that'll scale this up a bit.

16:24.360 --> 16:32.670
So I think I'm in a press this view area right here to give it a little bit more of a curve there.

16:32.890 --> 16:40.380
I think I'm going to add a couple of edges right in here and maybe a couple one more right in there.

16:40.510 --> 16:45.240
We'll be applying this to make this geometry permanent.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.480
But for now let's see how it's going to look.

16:48.850 --> 16:51.790
Let's start doing that with one of these over here.

16:51.790 --> 16:58.930
So I'm going to add a subdivision surface modifier take it up to let's say and let's start adding a

16:58.930 --> 17:00.340
few edge loops here.

17:01.670 --> 17:06.090
Maybe three s and X and scale those out of it.

17:07.380 --> 17:15.480
And let's maybe add three here s and Z and scale those up a bit and we go

17:17.850 --> 17:25.410
and looks like I've got those edges a little too close doesn't it all to click this edge and bring it

17:25.410 --> 17:33.150
down just a bit and maybe Allt click this edge and bring it back just to hair something like that.

17:33.360 --> 17:38.830
Maybe I'll add one right down the middle there and kind of hold that.

17:38.940 --> 17:39.790
All right.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.720
Let's take a look at these here.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.410
Now add a subdivision surface modifier.

17:46.410 --> 17:52.010
Same process.

17:52.050 --> 17:57.390
So we get a little bit of a curve to it and I'll take a look at this one too.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.630
I'll do the same thing for this one.

17:59.800 --> 18:10.380
So division surface two views and let's add a few adjectives here this time once again I'll go back

18:10.380 --> 18:19.320
to local mode and scale in the X like this and this over here.

18:20.390 --> 18:25.720
I'll scale on the Y all right.

18:25.960 --> 18:37.550
And this part right back here this kind of looks like I could soften this up a bit to now I use all

18:37.570 --> 18:43.530
these pillows as kind of just placeholders to get a sense of the size of this thing I'm going to go

18:43.530 --> 18:47.840
ahead and just delete these because I don't need them right now.

18:48.030 --> 18:53.480
I'm going to use these to try and get these the right size and shape

18:56.390 --> 19:06.900
so I'm going to go ahead and scale this out just a hair and maybe even take this add an edge in here

19:06.930 --> 19:14.910
and then scale this out just a little bit so I'll press ass and shift Z to make sure it doesn't scale

19:14.910 --> 19:15.410
and Z.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.780
I guess it wouldn't.

19:16.790 --> 19:20.780
What if it's only an edge so it wouldn't scale in the Z any way.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.330
Go ahead and

19:26.000 --> 19:34.710
take this point and just move it up just a hair other Zoll move down and kind of beat up the edges a

19:34.710 --> 19:35.460
bit.

19:35.640 --> 19:41.260
This down here I think I could scale in the z and maybe move up a bit.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.420
So it kind of pushes up against that.

19:44.490 --> 19:54.050
So they look a little bit like cushions and I'm just trying to scale and place this as best I can.

19:54.050 --> 19:58.560
I'll have the scale and wind to move that out a bit.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.600
There we go.

20:00.020 --> 20:05.330
So now let's go ahead and smooth these I'm going to go up to the tools tab here and right down under

20:05.330 --> 20:12.110
shading we have a smooth button and we can kind of take care of some of this blocking this or sitting

20:12.110 --> 20:18.380
here with this smooth button kind of like that gives us a little bit of a smoother

20:21.510 --> 20:22.990
look to the object.

20:24.610 --> 20:25.600
Something like that

20:33.740 --> 20:34.570
right.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.540
This looks a little move this backs.

20:43.930 --> 20:52.220
I just added an edge loop there and I think I want to scale this out just a bit and move it this way

20:52.220 --> 20:53.010
up a little bit.

20:53.030 --> 20:56.080
So it kind of intersects with that.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.760
Here we go.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.760
So now let me go ahead and duplicate these

21:04.530 --> 21:06.950
just to take a look at how it looks.

21:08.980 --> 21:09.730
Duplicate.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.770
And then why

21:13.990 --> 21:14.800
right.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.980
Yeah I think that's pretty good.

21:16.980 --> 21:26.550
I think maybe I want to make this arm just a little bit taller so s and Z maybe something like that.

21:26.910 --> 21:33.840
If I look at it here in the front view with three key or or the right view with the three key and then

21:33.840 --> 21:36.440
move that up just a bit like that.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.460
Let's take a look at it now.

21:42.770 --> 21:52.450
Yeah go ahead and delete this and move this over so I'll hit the 7 key and then the 5 key and the Z

21:52.450 --> 21:59.580
key as well and I'll select this one piece shift d y and move on up here.

21:59.590 --> 22:06.190
Now if you're having trouble getting the object right where you want it it seems to be moving too quickly

22:06.190 --> 22:07.140
for you.

22:07.240 --> 22:14.230
You can press the shift key while you're moving and it will move it in smaller increments just a little

22:14.230 --> 22:15.320
bit slower.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.810
So you can place it just where you want it.

22:20.050 --> 22:21.970
Right.

22:21.970 --> 22:25.540
So there we go there's the beginnings of our couch.

22:25.540 --> 22:28.450
Now the next thing we need to do is U-V map it.
