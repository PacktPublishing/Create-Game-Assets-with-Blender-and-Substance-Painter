WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:08.020
All right we have our coffee table here we can come down here and choose viewport shading texture or

00:08.050 --> 00:14.680
we can just press alt Z and we can see our texture Now I like what's going on up here on the top of

00:14.680 --> 00:21.730
it that looks sufficiently gross but I feel like the grunge is a little bit too heavy here.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.530
However I'm not going to change it quite yet.

00:25.630 --> 00:32.050
We could go into Photoshop and reduce the opacity of the grunge and bring it back in.

00:32.050 --> 00:39.110
And just like we did before remove the texture out of the texture node and then reopen it.

00:39.520 --> 00:46.060
But if we export the file directly into unity they will update automatically.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.400
So let's try that.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.050
What I'm do is go to Unity first and I'll drag in those textures.

00:52.060 --> 01:01.720
So let me go to my finder here and let's find those textures that we just created for the coffee table.

01:01.720 --> 01:06.310
And here they are here's the color map with the underscore see and the color map here.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.380
Let's drag those into the assets folder.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.500
Now let's take them straight into the textures.

01:10.510 --> 01:11.860
Let's do that.

01:12.160 --> 01:12.540
All right.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.280
So here they are coffee table top coffee table.

01:15.280 --> 01:21.730
Would I go back to blender and let's export this out as an FDX.

01:21.730 --> 01:28.250
Now before we do let's take a look at the size of the object and it's a little big.

01:28.250 --> 01:36.320
Of course that's OK I'll select that with that pivot point down on the grid on the floor.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.940
I can now scale this down a bit.

01:39.850 --> 01:45.390
And let's move it over and see how it fits in front of the couch.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.050
What do you think of that is it too big.

01:47.050 --> 01:49.900
I feel like it may be still a little too big here.

01:50.290 --> 01:52.680
So it's scale it down a bit more.

01:54.390 --> 01:55.490
Let's take a look at that.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.060
What do you think.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.640
I mean the three key the five key and the Z key.

02:02.660 --> 02:06.630
And let's take a look at it here I feel like it maybe needs to come down a little bit more kind of to

02:06.640 --> 02:11.300
the edge of the couch cushions something like that.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.490
Let's try that.

02:13.540 --> 02:21.400
Hit that Z key again the five key again to get a perspective view and well let's run around and see

02:21.400 --> 02:22.880
how it feels.

02:22.910 --> 02:27.510
I'll press shift F and then tab and that'll drop me down to the floor.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.710
And now I can use the WASC keys and run around.

02:31.720 --> 02:36.720
Let's see how it feels and think that feels pretty good.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.990
I think that looks OK.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.660
All right so I'll hit escape.

02:42.840 --> 02:47.410
Now we can export this out with RFB x x border.

02:47.550 --> 02:54.910
And as I mentioned we can of course drag blend files Blendr seen files here like this.

02:54.910 --> 02:59.940
Apartment 0 6 blend into unity and it'll import just fine.

02:59.940 --> 03:02.270
It will open up Blendr in the background.

03:02.310 --> 03:09.660
Use Blender's FDX export or convert it to an FBI X and then pop it in the assets folder and that's fine.

03:09.870 --> 03:16.330
But that's going to bring everything and we won't be able to split them out unless we move that FDX

03:16.340 --> 03:17.810
file into the hierarchy.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.550
Then we can split it out once it's actually in the scene.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.610
But I'd like to have control over each individual object.

03:23.640 --> 03:29.870
So now that we've scaled it down to the proper size we can see that our scale over here is point 3 5

03:29.880 --> 03:30.600
9.

03:30.600 --> 03:37.920
Let's go ahead and press control a and apply our transforms for the scale and now we've got scale at

03:37.920 --> 03:39.260
1.

03:39.270 --> 03:46.110
So now let's go ahead and export this out using our FDX export or we'll go to a file export FDX let's

03:46.110 --> 03:55.920
be sure and choose selected objects and I am going to choose my Unity project this time instead of taking

03:55.920 --> 03:57.500
it into that exports folder.

03:57.510 --> 04:05.070
I'm going to export this directly into the unity project so I'll go into that unity project folder go

04:05.070 --> 04:08.660
into the assets folder and we'll call this coffee table.

04:08.710 --> 04:13.950
FDX and I'll export and there we go.

04:13.970 --> 04:21.280
Now if I go back to unity and look in the assets folder we can see that the coffee table is right here

04:21.980 --> 04:29.200
and it's put our coffee table materials right in here in the materials folder.

04:29.210 --> 04:35.900
So even though it's all one object the multiple materials have come through as individual materials

04:35.930 --> 04:37.100
in unity.

04:37.100 --> 04:37.360
All right.

04:37.370 --> 04:41.210
So let's take it and drag it into the hierarchy.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.150
It's going to drop in right where we left it.

04:44.240 --> 04:48.500
I'll hit the F key to zoom in and frame it up.

04:48.890 --> 04:57.570
And now we have our coffee table so let's put our textures on it now we have our materials over here.

04:57.610 --> 05:00.340
So for the wood here it is.

05:00.420 --> 05:09.290
I will come into the textures folder that's like our coffee table again and I'll drag the word texture

05:09.290 --> 05:18.110
mapping to here and take that color and drag it to pure white and now I'll open up that coffee table

05:18.110 --> 05:28.170
top let's take that to pure white and take that coffee table top texture and drop that in as well.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.350
So now we've got our textured object.

05:31.380 --> 05:38.160
But remember I said I'm not real fond of that grunge man being quite that dark.

05:38.160 --> 05:44.880
So let's go into Photoshop again and let's reduce the opacity of that.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.540
Here we are.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.000
Take that grunge map and we've got an opacity of thirty nine.

05:49.010 --> 05:49.880
I'll take it down.

05:49.890 --> 05:53.840
I don't know maybe down to 20 something like that.

05:55.240 --> 05:59.110
So it isn't quite as pronounced now that we've done that.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.180
Let's go ahead and save it out again.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.590
And export.

06:04.870 --> 06:12.720
But this time put it directly in the unity project so instead of putting it here I'll go ahead and code

06:12.720 --> 06:14.000
of the unity project.

06:14.990 --> 06:22.210
And of the assets folder and the textures folder and I'll choose that coffee table would underscore

06:22.210 --> 06:27.290
see and export and replace.

06:27.410 --> 06:34.940
Now instead of having to go into blender to see how the update looks and cancel out of the texture and

06:34.940 --> 06:36.740
then reopen the texture.

06:37.010 --> 06:42.450
If we go back to unity it's just done it for us.

06:42.520 --> 06:48.750
So now we can see that the grunge on the coffee table isn't quite so pronounced.

06:49.930 --> 06:55.000
Now to keep things a little more tidy I will come back to the assets folder and just take this coffee

06:55.000 --> 07:00.250
table object and drag it into the model's folder.

07:00.250 --> 07:09.130
And here we go and I can hit the play button here and run around and see how our table and dirty couch

07:09.310 --> 07:10.460
look so far.

07:10.670 --> 07:12.970
Yeah right.

07:13.330 --> 07:20.920
So we've gone through now several ways of importing our objects with differing ways of organizing our

07:20.920 --> 07:22.100
materials.

07:22.210 --> 07:31.120
We've brought in the couch as two different objects the fabric and the wood legs we've brought in the

07:31.120 --> 07:38.280
walls as all one object each with multiple materials on the single object.

07:38.470 --> 07:41.440
But everything all in one U-V map.

07:42.160 --> 07:48.540
And then we've brought in our coffee table here with everything in one object.

07:48.970 --> 07:58.830
Multiple materials on that one object but individual optimized U-V maps for each of the materials.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.820
So you may have heard me say this before and other courses but I think it's worth saying again and it

08:03.820 --> 08:06.130
took me a while for this to actually sink in.

08:06.130 --> 08:14.630
So materials are applied to objects and textures are assigned to materials.

08:14.890 --> 08:24.460
So you can have multiple materials per object but each material is going to accept one texture per texture

08:24.490 --> 08:28.220
channel like the color channel or albedo.

08:28.690 --> 08:34.960
My point to all this is to try and get you to think about the differing ways that you can create objects

08:35.260 --> 08:43.570
assigned materials and assign textures to your game objects because how you set up the materials and

08:43.570 --> 08:51.760
the textures and the U.V. maps is going to affect the quality and the look of your game objects.

08:51.760 --> 08:57.020
So we're going to be doing this more We've of course got lots of other assets to create.

08:57.280 --> 09:04.500
But there's one more way I want to show you how we can organize our objects materials and textures.

09:04.870 --> 09:13.480
And that is when we take an object from Blender into a program like Quick's or studio or substance painter.

09:13.750 --> 09:19.570
You can use all of these processes for those texturing applications as well.

09:19.570 --> 09:24.930
But there's one more that we can use for them and we'll work on that next.
