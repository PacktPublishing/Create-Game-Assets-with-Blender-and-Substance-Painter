00:00.830 --> 00:06.440
As we think about creating the baseboards for our walls here we're also going to need to think about

00:06.440 --> 00:14.600
creating the doors if we go back over to this reference image we can see the baseboard kind of flows

00:14.630 --> 00:19.200
into the frame around the doors and I think I want to go ahead and do that.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.800
So before we work on the baseboards let's work on the doors.

00:24.140 --> 00:31.340
If we look out on the Internet here out on Google I've searched standard door dimensions here in the

00:31.340 --> 00:39.320
United States we've got standard door size of 80 inches by 36 inches or about six feet eight by three

00:39.320 --> 00:39.620
feet.

00:39.620 --> 00:42.440
So I think I want to go for something about that.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.650
Now it also says that eight feet now is very common in newer homes.

00:46.650 --> 00:52.000
This I don't think this is going to be a newer build this is kind of an old run down apartment.

00:52.010 --> 00:59.930
So I think I'll go with the six foot eight maybe even seven feet for the doors and three feet wide for

00:59.930 --> 01:00.680
the width.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.010
So let's work on that.

01:03.020 --> 01:08.920
I think I'll go to a new lair here and just create a cube or go to the Create tab and click on cube

01:10.370 --> 01:13.490
and now it popped in here over where the cursor was.

01:13.490 --> 01:17.450
I don't want that I'm going to undo this with control or command Z.

01:17.450 --> 01:18.970
I'm going to press shift.

01:19.030 --> 01:24.710
See and that will pop the 3D cursor into the center of the grid.

01:24.710 --> 01:30.530
Now come back over here and create a cube and let's hit the N key and take a look at the dimensions

01:30.590 --> 01:31.780
of our cube.

01:32.030 --> 01:38.630
Now remember over here in the scene panel we've got our units of measure we're currently using metric

01:38.660 --> 01:44.390
but temporarily since I know this door is going to be seven feet by three feet wide I'm going to click

01:44.480 --> 01:46.580
Imperial and switch over to that.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.700
So now I can see that the Z-axis here is six feet.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.930
So I'll go ahead and just type 7 into here and that will make this seven feet tall.

01:57.200 --> 02:04.610
And then I think I'll use the x axis here the x axis lets make 3 feet wide.

02:04.610 --> 02:05.940
And there we go.

02:05.960 --> 02:12.020
Now I can press X and Y and scale in and the y axis just a little bit.

02:12.470 --> 02:17.770
But ultimately this is going to be the width and height of our door.

02:17.780 --> 02:24.350
Now if I go back to the metric system here you can see it's done the conversions for us in terms of

02:24.410 --> 02:26.380
meters and centimeters.

02:26.390 --> 02:32.240
So now I want to bring this up so it's sitting on the floor I'm gonna hit the one key and then the five

02:32.240 --> 02:40.100
key on the numpad and I'll just bring this up until it sits on the grid right about there.

02:40.130 --> 02:48.050
Now if I go back to my imperial units of measure I can see that I'm here at 3.5 feet which is half of

02:48.110 --> 02:48.870
seven.

02:48.950 --> 02:54.830
I'll go ahead and clean up that by just typing in 3.5 and now I know that that's sitting squarely or

02:54.830 --> 02:58.100
flat on the grid on the floor there.

02:58.130 --> 03:04.250
All right so now that we know that this is our door size I'm going to hit the five key to go back to

03:04.310 --> 03:05.740
perspective.

03:05.900 --> 03:14.440
We can bring back everything else in our room and take a look at where we're going to put our doors.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.070
So I think maybe beginning is going to be right over here.

03:18.070 --> 03:23.330
We're going to have that front door come in right about here.

03:23.330 --> 03:30.430
Let's say now that we know how big and wide that's going to be I can select the wall tab into edit mode

03:30.490 --> 03:37.540
and I will go ahead and press control r and begin putting some edge loops right where the door is going

03:37.540 --> 03:41.180
to be control are.

03:41.610 --> 03:43.250
Here's the top of the door.

03:43.710 --> 03:51.940
Control our in here this side of the door so I can begin to put these edges right where the door is

03:51.950 --> 03:52.610
going to be.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.910
Yeah that looks good.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.830
That looks good.

03:55.840 --> 03:56.750
OK.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.830
So now we know that that's going to be the size of the door on a tab back into object mode so I can

04:02.830 --> 04:04.800
select just this.

04:04.810 --> 04:09.250
This is on the third letter of someone to press shift and click to hide that.

04:09.250 --> 04:18.440
Now if we tab back into edit mode here I can go to face mode and select these faces and get rid of these.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.060
So I'll hit X and faces.

04:21.070 --> 04:28.450
I also want to get rid of this one here and there is our door now to create the door jamb.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.580
Let's do something a little tricky here.

04:30.580 --> 04:36.730
I want to go to edge mode so I press control tab and the two key to go to edge mode and I want to select

04:37.030 --> 04:40.030
this edge all the way around.

04:40.360 --> 04:45.090
Except I don't want these down here all de-selected these down here.

04:45.090 --> 04:51.640
Now I'm going to bridge these two edge loops so to do that I can press control e to go to the edges

04:51.700 --> 04:58.240
menu and then come down here and go to bridge edge loops and that will just create a face between each

04:58.240 --> 04:59.730
of the edges.

04:59.740 --> 05:03.400
All right so now we have that that's the inside of the door jamb.

05:03.400 --> 05:10.300
Let's split this out and then we can extrude it out to make the door jam extend out over the wall here.

05:10.690 --> 05:17.350
So to do that I'll press the P key and then choose to separate this out by the selection.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.850
Click that.

05:18.850 --> 05:24.100
Now if I tab back into object mode this right here is its own object now.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.740
So I can scale this out a bit in the y axis to extend it beyond the wall just ahead.

05:29.740 --> 05:36.080
So I'll press S and Y and scale that out just a little like that.

05:37.550 --> 05:40.800
Now I it extrude these edges out.

05:40.940 --> 05:47.780
Now I don't really care too much about the outside but if you did we can go ahead and work on that too.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.180
So we'll just do that all at the same time.

05:50.280 --> 05:57.170
I'll tab back into edit mode and I'll select all of these edges once again by by pressing alt and click

05:57.170 --> 06:04.070
on an edge and then shift bolt and click on an edge and that selects these two edges on the inside and

06:04.070 --> 06:05.680
the outside of the room.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.130
I'll then hit e to extrude and then click.

06:09.140 --> 06:16.890
And now I'm going to scale just in the x axis x x and now that moves these out a bit.

06:16.930 --> 06:27.470
So and then are de-select these shift click these shift click these to de-select.

06:27.500 --> 06:33.810
Now theoretically these edges are still selected up here so I can just click and drag in the Z-axis

06:33.890 --> 06:35.570
and pull those up.

06:35.600 --> 06:41.380
So there we have the door jam around the front door.

06:41.420 --> 06:52.010
Now I can select these edges again alt click shift alt click so we select all of those and then we extrude

06:52.010 --> 06:54.050
again hit the e key and click.

06:54.050 --> 07:01.830
And now I want to scale in the y axis to bring that back to the wall so I'll press S and then Y.

07:02.060 --> 07:06.050
And now we scale it back in to the wall right there.

07:06.050 --> 07:06.530
All right.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.460
So there is the front door jam.

07:09.980 --> 07:12.410
Let's go do that to the other wall over here.

07:12.560 --> 07:21.260
So over here on this side of the room we need two doors one kind of at each corner here so I'll bring

07:21.260 --> 07:23.990
back that door template.

07:24.380 --> 07:24.920
Where is it.

07:24.920 --> 07:31.810
There it is and take that over here and maybe put it right in line with the front door perhaps maybe

07:31.810 --> 07:39.790
right there or center it up with the period key on the numpad select that wall tab into edit mode and

07:39.790 --> 07:50.860
then lets put a few edges here as well around the door and let's choose these faces and get rid of these.

07:50.970 --> 07:58.320
And now since I have this door jam created for this door size Why not just take this sense it's its

07:58.320 --> 08:01.070
own object and drag it right on over there.

08:01.170 --> 08:07.320
Now the pivot point or the center of the object is right over here I'm going to move it to the geometry

08:07.330 --> 08:12.810
so it's kind of centered up within that door to do that I'll come over here to the tools tab and we

08:12.810 --> 08:20.190
can use this set origin pull down and click that and choose origin to geometry and that moves that into

08:20.190 --> 08:21.820
the center there.

08:21.900 --> 08:29.730
Now I can just hit shift d click and then click on the y axis here and just drag it right over.

08:29.940 --> 08:36.900
I mean hit the period key and I'll put this right kind of right in here we go.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.730
All right let's do that one more time.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.940
Over on this side.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.750
Move it over here.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.840
Let's try it right about.

08:44.850 --> 08:48.950
I don't know right about there let's say and block it out.

08:50.600 --> 08:56.620
With some edges here I already have the edge for the top of the door Mallet's get rid of that.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.180
Turn off the lever for the door template and let's remove these again.

09:02.680 --> 09:03.030
All right.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.010
And let's just move the door jamb right over there.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.230
Let's go ahead and add the baseboards to the walls.

09:12.230 --> 09:18.280
Now that we have the doors in place let's begin with this one over here.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.960
I'm going to press control r and add an edge right about here.

09:22.960 --> 09:32.440
And once I do now I'm going to press the three key and five key and the Z key and let's take a look

09:32.440 --> 09:34.500
at this in wireframe.

09:34.510 --> 09:38.850
Most are going to press the end key to give myself a little bit more room now.

09:38.950 --> 09:44.060
It looks like I need the one key I'll press the one key to come over to this side.

09:44.500 --> 09:49.060
Now once again I'm going to click and drag with the Z-axis but then I'm gonna to hold that shift key

09:49.060 --> 09:53.020
down so I can move it a little slower and get it right where I want it.

09:53.020 --> 09:58.790
So maybe something like that at something like that.

09:58.790 --> 10:01.020
Now let me do that over here as well.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.980
Move that down to about where I want it.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.630
Write about there.

10:07.640 --> 10:14.360
All right so now we have the size or location of the baseboard in place here.

10:14.530 --> 10:19.120
We just need to use this edge to create them on the other walls as well.

10:19.120 --> 10:26.230
So if we tap back into object mode and select this wall and then put a 1 and 5 key in the z key for

10:26.230 --> 10:31.080
wireframe we can see that we can't see that baseboard.

10:31.150 --> 10:31.780
Why is that.

10:31.780 --> 10:38.830
Well it's because our display settings isn't letting us see all of our edges in object mode.

10:38.860 --> 10:44.980
If I tab and edit mode for this while I still can't see the edges for that other wall because it's a

10:44.980 --> 10:46.000
whole other object.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.930
So do we need to combine those walls together.

10:48.940 --> 10:55.480
No we can just play with the display settings of our objects so we can see that edge.

10:55.480 --> 11:02.230
So if I tumble out of this and just select that wall again I can come over to the objects settings here

11:03.070 --> 11:06.670
and down here under wire and draw all edges.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.650
We can turn these on so we can see the edges.

11:09.700 --> 11:15.360
So now that we've turned on draw all edges I can come back and hit the one key.

11:15.380 --> 11:21.990
Now you can see we can see that edge even though that other object is an object mode.

11:22.030 --> 11:22.290
All right.

11:22.300 --> 11:28.730
So let me select this wall here hit that one key tab into edit mode.

11:28.740 --> 11:33.390
And now we've got a reference here of how big the baseboard should be.

11:33.390 --> 11:41.530
So I'll press control our and click and then bring this down right about there and same thing over here.

11:41.530 --> 11:48.010
Control our and let's do that again right over here.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.060
All right.

11:49.330 --> 11:52.310
So now we have our baseboards.

11:52.330 --> 11:56.610
There we just need to put them over here as well.

11:56.620 --> 12:03.220
Now I can go ahead and turn on the wire and draw edges over here and then I'll hit the three key the

12:03.220 --> 12:11.050
Z key tab into edit mode and we can see this the height of the baseboard and on each of the other walls

12:11.050 --> 12:17.680
here while press control our and just add an edge right there.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.530
Just need it one more time on this wall back here.

12:22.790 --> 12:27.080
Three key tab and one more time.

12:30.200 --> 12:37.820
So in the next video what we need to do is go ahead and U-V map the walls U-V map the door jambs and

12:37.820 --> 12:42.040
then begin thinking about our textures and taking it into unity.
