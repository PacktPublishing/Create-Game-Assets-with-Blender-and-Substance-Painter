WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:04.850
Now when we took the couch into unity we took it in as two different objects.

00:05.110 --> 00:12.520
And I did that to be able to access the individual materials that we needed so we needed one material

00:12.520 --> 00:20.770
to be able to do the texture for the fabric and we needed another material to do the wood for the legs.

00:20.770 --> 00:27.520
Now just because we need multiple materials doesn't mean we necessarily need multiple objects.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.960
So that's kind of the reason I did the walls the way I did here.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.890
Let me press shift h to isolate that and then I'll press the period key again to frame that Slyke that

00:38.890 --> 00:39.870
object up.

00:39.940 --> 00:47.750
Now what I want here is I want one texture on the wall and a different texture on the baseboard.

00:47.770 --> 00:53.400
So let me actually just extrude this baseboard out just a tiny bit.

00:53.410 --> 00:59.470
I'm going to hit the e key to extrude and then I'm going to hold the shift key down and move the mouse

00:59.470 --> 01:00.710
out just a little bit.

01:00.710 --> 01:05.550
So it's about like that just a little bit of an edge on that baseboard.

01:05.560 --> 01:12.610
Now I could have made the wall its own object and the baseboard its own object just create a cube and

01:12.700 --> 01:14.920
scale it to make the baseboard.

01:14.980 --> 01:22.060
But I want to just talk about yet another way to export and import objects from Blender into unity.

01:22.090 --> 01:31.990
So let's take this wall for an example and I'm going to go ahead and create seams for the U.V. map so

01:32.020 --> 01:34.620
I'll select this edge here.

01:35.170 --> 01:40.360
And I'm just going to select the edge all the way around the baseboard.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.920
It looks like pressing Allt and shift got me all the way around.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.470
That's good so I'm in a press control me and Mark.

01:49.810 --> 01:55.570
I'm also going to split out this portion of the wall this is the part that's going to be seen so I want

01:55.570 --> 02:00.220
to just press control and Mark seem here as well.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.600
So the rest of the wall back here is really not going to be used.

02:04.630 --> 02:12.250
But what I'm doing is I'm giving the wall some thickness to prevent light leaking in unity.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.350
Sometimes if you bring in a single plane you can get light leak through the walls if you're dealing

02:17.350 --> 02:18.820
with an interior scene.

02:18.820 --> 02:21.460
Now there are ways to get around that as well.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.990
There's always other ways to do things though.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.650
But that's why I'm using thicknesse on the wall here.

02:28.660 --> 02:32.110
All right so we have our seams on our wall actually.

02:32.110 --> 02:42.940
I might even come in here and get really persnickety and put a couple of seems right here and way over

02:42.940 --> 02:44.860
here on the other side.

02:44.860 --> 02:49.730
Just a couple of seams right here as well.

02:50.850 --> 02:51.560
All right.

02:51.870 --> 02:56.640
So now let's go to our U-V editor right over here.

02:57.250 --> 03:03.970
And I'm just going to select all the objects or Scuse me all the polygons with the a key press you and

03:04.000 --> 03:07.030
unwrap and so there we have the map.

03:07.030 --> 03:13.900
Now if we switch from angle based to conformal look how big of a difference there is.

03:13.900 --> 03:20.110
And you can see up here it says object has nonuniform scale and that's a clue I think as you switch

03:20.110 --> 03:27.520
back from Angle base to conformal that you need to come in and apply your transforms to get uniform

03:27.580 --> 03:28.440
scale.

03:28.480 --> 03:37.570
If I hit the end key again we can take a look up here and see an object node that the scale is nonuniform.

03:37.630 --> 03:44.210
So in Object mode I'll just press control a and apply rotation in scale and there we go.

03:44.320 --> 03:55.200
So now when we come back into Edit Mode hit you and unwrap Here's conformal Here's angle based not a

03:55.200 --> 03:57.120
whole lot of difference.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.300
However I do like conformal a little better there.

04:00.600 --> 04:07.890
Now just while we're here I may need to know at some point in time when we go into Photoshop which U-V

04:07.890 --> 04:12.890
Island is the baseboard and which is the actual front of the wall.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.690
It may be a little confusing here as to which is which.

04:16.710 --> 04:22.530
So if I come down here and turn this little guy right down here keep U-V in edit mode mesh selection

04:22.560 --> 04:23.220
in sync.

04:23.220 --> 04:32.730
If I turn that on now if I go to face mode and select a face over here it highlights over here so you

04:32.730 --> 04:40.710
can see that that face is right here and if I select this wall there is the U-V island there so I've

04:40.710 --> 04:44.490
got the baseboard on top and the wall here beneath it.

04:44.490 --> 04:51.660
And down here is the back of the wall but the back of the wall does not need to be this large.

04:51.660 --> 04:57.810
In fact we could shrink that down quite a bit so we can get a little bit more just a little bit more

04:58.230 --> 05:02.560
resolution in our U-V map for our wall and our baseboard.

05:02.580 --> 05:09.210
So if I come back over here and turn this off select everything over here so I can see all of these.

05:09.500 --> 05:15.630
I'm now choosing to select my U-V islands here with this option.

05:15.720 --> 05:22.290
So if I select Now the back wall I can hit s and shrink it way down and maybe put it over here in a

05:22.290 --> 05:24.110
corner I don't need that.

05:24.120 --> 05:31.770
Now what I can do is press control up arrow and make this full screen and then I'll just select these

05:31.770 --> 05:37.760
two U-V islands and scale them up just a bit so I get a little bit more resolution out of it.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.730
Can't get a whole lot but that'll work.

05:42.190 --> 05:46.700
We could put more in this U-V island or this U-V map.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.220
But for now let's go with this.

05:49.240 --> 05:49.510
All right.

05:49.510 --> 05:56.530
So I'm going to get control up arrow to shrink that down again and now as I mentioned we need to split

05:56.530 --> 06:03.340
out the materials or create a material for the wall and the baseboard so that unity will see the different

06:03.340 --> 06:09.600
materials and to do that all we need to do is just select the individual faces and assign them.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.800
All right so we have this movie map.

06:11.800 --> 06:19.450
However if we go back here you know what I think if I hit the tab key to go to object mode and press

06:19.600 --> 06:29.690
alt h to bring everything back I think what we need to do is actually split this wall out from the wall

06:29.690 --> 06:35.020
that would be here because within the kitchen it's going to have I think a paint texture.

06:35.030 --> 06:41.730
And in the living room it's going to have a really ugly worn down torn bit of wallpaper.

06:41.780 --> 06:47.690
So I think I'm going to need to scale this and duplicate it.

06:47.690 --> 06:48.960
So let me do that.

06:48.980 --> 06:53.670
I'm going to scale this in the y axis with X and Y and bring this down a bit.

06:53.900 --> 07:09.160
Move it over some and then scale it back out just a hair and we go now to duplicate this hit the Y key

07:09.160 --> 07:12.140
to move it in the y axis and bring this over here.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.830
And then I'll scale this down here in the y axis with x and y.

07:17.830 --> 07:18.950
Let's try that.

07:21.780 --> 07:22.980
Here we go.

07:22.980 --> 07:31.940
All right so now we've got two different walls for the two different parts of the apartment.

07:31.950 --> 07:35.840
One for the kitchen one for the living room.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.870
All right so let me go back real quick and just reuse the map.

07:38.880 --> 07:51.420
This piece right here I'm going to press shift h period key tab into edit mode you and unwrap and there

07:51.420 --> 07:52.560
we go.

07:52.560 --> 07:59.870
Once again I've got nonuniform scale hit control a notation and scale and do that one more time.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.330
There we go.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.500
That looks a little better.

08:02.580 --> 08:11.190
I'll scale down that back of the wall again and I'll scale up the actual part of the wall that we will

08:11.190 --> 08:11.940
use.

08:12.270 --> 08:13.950
And we go all right.

08:13.950 --> 08:17.400
I think that'll make a little more sense.

08:17.430 --> 08:24.060
So now that we have our wall the right size and U-V map let's go ahead and assign our materials to it

08:24.400 --> 08:31.110
I'll go to the materials panel over here and recall this is one that I created by just clicking and

08:31.110 --> 08:38.820
dragging this little corner tab out this panel doesn't come automatically with the U-V editing screen

08:38.850 --> 08:39.300
layout.

08:39.300 --> 08:43.430
I just created this earlier but I'll hit the New button.

08:43.440 --> 08:49.640
I'll call this wall living room back.

08:50.020 --> 08:57.820
And then I will tab into edit mode select this one face here and press control plus key on the numpad

08:57.820 --> 09:02.410
to expand the selection out to encompass all of the baseboard.

09:02.410 --> 09:07.120
Then I'll create a new material slot for this object right here.

09:08.690 --> 09:16.340
And in that new material slot in the object I will create a new material and we'll call this baseboard

09:16.790 --> 09:23.450
living back wall and then I would click a sign and there we go.

09:23.750 --> 09:30.380
So now if we take a look at this I'll hit the Z key to go to wireframe if I choose that wall.

09:30.380 --> 09:37.860
Living back and click select everything highlights except the baseboard.

09:37.930 --> 09:45.820
I can hit de-select here and now if I select the baseboard and click select only the baseboard is selected.

09:45.820 --> 09:54.550
So now we have two materials assigned to our one object and unity will see this as we take this object

09:54.550 --> 09:55.500
in.

09:55.510 --> 09:59.410
Now I'm gonna need to go through and do this for all the other walls as well.

09:59.530 --> 10:05.380
But while we're here what I want to do is go ahead and work on the doorframes on a press alt h to bring

10:05.380 --> 10:14.950
everything back and let me grab this doorframe right here and press shift h to isolate it period key

10:14.950 --> 10:16.740
to focus it.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.800
And let's take a look at creating argufy map of this.

10:20.800 --> 10:29.620
Now one thing about doorways is that they usually have a little extrusion inside here where the door

10:29.680 --> 10:30.430
fits.

10:30.430 --> 10:36.580
So before I U-V map it I better insert those edge loops and extrude that I'll press control are.

10:36.930 --> 10:39.560
And let's do two.

10:39.580 --> 10:48.190
I just scroll the mouse wheel to get one more extra edge there and click and click again and I will

10:48.190 --> 10:51.830
press S and y to scale these in a bit.

10:53.510 --> 10:54.250
And click.

10:54.260 --> 11:00.140
And then I'll move them forward just a bit like that because the door is going to be here on this side

11:00.140 --> 11:02.360
of the door jamb.

11:02.550 --> 11:11.520
And then I can go to face mode all click and edge between two of the faces to select that whole face

11:11.520 --> 11:12.750
loop.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.730
And now I want to extrude all hit E and the Enter key.

11:16.740 --> 11:22.980
So now what I want to do is just scale these in I'll scale it first in the X all it s and X and scale

11:22.980 --> 11:26.630
that in just a smidge.

11:27.300 --> 11:35.550
I'll press the shift key to move a little slower here like that and then I'll de-selected these two

11:38.190 --> 11:42.940
and with this face still psyched it all pulled down just a hair right there.

11:43.970 --> 11:44.940
All right.

11:45.180 --> 11:50.280
Now we can delete the faces on the bottom we don't need those.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.230
And there we go.

11:51.230 --> 11:53.600
So there we have the door jamb for that.

11:53.600 --> 11:58.620
I'll just U-V map this and then duplicate it for the other two doors.

11:58.790 --> 12:08.570
Maybe we can create seams here all the way around maybe here.

12:09.690 --> 12:14.060
And maybe here as well so we can split these out.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.190
Let's get this corner as well.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.130
All right so let's see how this works I will press control.

12:20.430 --> 12:26.350
Mark seem and then select everything press you and unwrap.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.380
How do we do.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.810
Not too bad.

12:29.060 --> 12:31.800
Once again nonuniform scale.

12:31.970 --> 12:36.530
Go back to object mode control a rotation scale.

12:36.530 --> 12:43.520
Now let's say that you and unwrap and there we have it a little bit more in line with the proportion

12:43.520 --> 12:46.490
and scale of the actual object.

12:46.580 --> 12:47.330
That's not bad.

12:47.330 --> 12:51.790
Let's take a look at angle based and conformal.

12:52.040 --> 12:59.690
Not much difference at all and that's what I mean by when you see a large difference in your U-V map

12:59.690 --> 13:01.940
between conformal and angle based.

13:01.940 --> 13:10.960
You may want to go back and apply the transformations so you have a uniform scale before you unwrap.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.850
All right so I've got that done.

13:12.870 --> 13:19.470
I'm going to go back to the default view and let's just copy these back over alt h to bring everything

13:19.470 --> 13:20.360
back.

13:20.880 --> 13:28.540
And I think I'll just take this door frame and this one and go ahead and delete them.

13:28.740 --> 13:38.100
Select this one and duplicate shifty hit the x key and slide it over here chiff D.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.970
This time I'll press the Y key for y axis and move it over here.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.750
So what I will do before the next video is I'll go ahead and go through and U-V map the other walls

13:50.470 --> 13:53.850
and then we'll begin taking these into unity and see how they look.
