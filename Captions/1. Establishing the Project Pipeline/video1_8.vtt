WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:04.410
Now there is another object as part of this couch.

00:04.410 --> 00:09.810
Remember that we have these legs at the bottom of the couch that need to be textured as well.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.670
We're not going to see a whole lot of them we can probably use a pretty small texture but we do need

00:14.670 --> 00:16.410
to get something on there.

00:16.470 --> 00:20.760
I'm thinking just a basic woodgrain texture would be fine.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.600
So I'm just going to go out to Google and just see what I can find.

00:25.020 --> 00:34.890
So I think I'll just type in wood grain texture and see what I come up with many good images and I'm

00:34.890 --> 00:42.260
going to go to search tools and size and large just so I get a fairly good size texture.

00:42.270 --> 00:48.030
Now most of these are not going to be seamless and that's fine I don't really need a seamless texture

00:48.030 --> 00:49.280
for this.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.820
This looks kind of nice.

00:50.820 --> 00:52.040
Let me grab this one.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.720
Yeah that looks good.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.910
I'll go to view image right click save images and I'll put this in my textures.

01:01.290 --> 01:01.680
All right.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.360
So that's the one we're going to use.

01:03.390 --> 01:09.450
I'll go back to blender now and let's select the legs of the couch shall tab into edit mode.

01:09.450 --> 01:13.330
Hit a to select everything and there is our U-V map.

01:13.350 --> 01:21.010
Let's go ahead and export this U.V. map out and take it into Photoshop so I'll go to Uvas export U-V

01:21.010 --> 01:22.510
lay out.

01:22.590 --> 01:29.010
I don't need the size to be very big here so I'll just choose five 12 and I'll go ahead and take it

01:29.030 --> 01:37.470
into the proper folders so here's my project folder Here's my textures I've got my couch folder here

01:38.100 --> 01:46.160
and in here I'll put couch legs underscore Uvas just so I know what it is.

01:46.380 --> 01:52.760
And now I'll go to photoshop and open it up there here in Photoshop all press control or command.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.090
Oh and browse to that folder.

01:57.200 --> 01:57.800
Here it is.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.190
Couch legs Uvas open.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.070
And here we go.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.980
I'll press control or command plus to zoom into it a bit.

02:07.420 --> 02:13.350
I will rename this Larry Uvas and I'll go ahead and press control or command.

02:13.540 --> 02:23.840
To open that other file so back in my textures folder over here I've got that woodgrain over here.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.190
Here it is Yep that's it.

02:27.190 --> 02:34.900
I'll open that up and then I'll press control or command a controller command C to copy it and come

02:34.900 --> 02:38.590
back over here and press control or command VI.

02:38.890 --> 02:45.730
And now that paste that in I'll zoom out with command minus or control minus as well.

02:46.060 --> 02:52.330
I'll take this layer and move it down below the U.V. so we can see the U.V. map and then I'll shrink

02:52.330 --> 02:55.630
this down by pressing shift and click and drag.

02:55.870 --> 03:02.780
So I think probably I will zoom in with the Z key here.

03:03.640 --> 03:08.510
I think I can get away with this particular size for the texture.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
That's not bad.

03:09.730 --> 03:14.240
Actually I think I'll just stretch it down just a bit so it covers these two.

03:14.350 --> 03:21.170
And then our press alt shift and I'll drag this down a bit and just put it right there.

03:21.340 --> 03:21.670
All right.

03:21.670 --> 03:28.930
So there we have our Uvas or our textures laid over our Uvas to clean it up a little.

03:28.930 --> 03:38.140
Again I can select that Uvas layer come over here to the magic wand tool or the W key click anywhere

03:38.140 --> 03:46.460
outside the movies shift click anywhere that didn't get covered looks like here and up here.

03:47.410 --> 03:49.360
And we go maybe down here as well.

03:50.350 --> 03:57.910
Now that we've got all of that area selected I'm going to contract it by going up to select and modify

03:57.910 --> 04:05.660
and contract and I'll contract by two pixels and that will spread it out just a little bit beyond the

04:05.660 --> 04:08.320
U.V. so we don't cut anything off in there.

04:08.320 --> 04:14.580
And then I can select this one and hit delete and slick this one and hit delete.

04:15.370 --> 04:23.150
And now I can come in here and add a new layer I'll click the new layers button down here drag it to

04:23.150 --> 04:32.700
the bottom and I'll just choose a black color and that paint bucket and put a black color behind it.

04:33.080 --> 04:38.430
Turn off the movies and there is my color map for the couch legs.

04:38.930 --> 04:43.700
Let's save it out with shift old controller command W

04:47.230 --> 04:55.840
and I'll just export as a P and G export and I'll call this couch legs underscore.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.810
See.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.180
And there we go for a color map.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.700
Now I'll go ahead and save this file here.

05:02.700 --> 05:10.260
Controller command s and I'll save this just as a P.S. d file catalogs.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.080
There we go.

05:12.390 --> 05:18.280
So now once again we have everything in that folder are S-D files are UVM map.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.480
And our final textures.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.580
So let's take this into unity now.

05:23.410 --> 05:30.010
And I'll bring up a Finder window here and here is my color map right here.

05:30.010 --> 05:34.560
I'll hit spacebar to open that up just so we can see that that's what that is.

05:34.900 --> 05:35.820
Good.

05:35.830 --> 05:44.320
I'll drag it down into unity into the assets folder I'll select that couch would object that is the

05:44.440 --> 05:46.150
couch legs right here.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.630
And I'll drag that couch legs color map into the Al bedo slot right here.

05:51.630 --> 05:57.330
And once again when the material comes in from Blendr it's going to be kind of gray so I'm going to

05:57.330 --> 05:59.670
move that up to pure white.

05:59.670 --> 06:00.500
And there we go.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.800
So if we take a look at that there they are.

06:04.100 --> 06:04.890
All right.

06:05.010 --> 06:10.590
And as I said I don't think I need to worry too much about dirtying these up or doing any more to that.

06:10.590 --> 06:14.080
That's these are going to be in shadow very small on the scene.

06:14.100 --> 06:18.420
I'm not too concerned about it but we needed something there.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.950
All right so now that we have all these textures in here I'm going to go ahead and clean that just a

06:22.950 --> 06:23.930
little bit.

06:23.940 --> 06:29.990
I'm going to create a new folder by right clicking the assets window and choosing create folder and

06:30.000 --> 06:38.350
let's just call this textures and I'll move these things down into that folder.

06:38.790 --> 06:42.730
And we go now we've got our models here.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.890
Our materials here and our textures here.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.480
All right.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.390
So let's go back to Blendr And let's take a look at creating the walls of the room.

06:53.680 --> 07:00.220
Now that we have our couch let's take a look at creating this room a little bit more or at least blocking

07:00.220 --> 07:01.840
out the walls.

07:01.840 --> 07:10.960
So I'm going to step back into object mode here and bring back these walls the floor and our scale.

07:10.960 --> 07:18.130
Now let's go take a look at that reference image that we initially looked at to get the general layout

07:18.130 --> 07:19.480
of the room.

07:19.480 --> 07:25.480
I'm thinking that the front door is going to be over here on the right side of the photo.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.620
And the windows are going to be over here on the left.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.210
So let's see if we can block these walls in and kind of get a sense of what the space is going to take

07:34.210 --> 07:35.140
this couch.

07:35.140 --> 07:41.260
Let me go back to the layer that it's on and I'm going to select everything and I want to make it into

07:41.260 --> 07:46.990
a group so that I can just select that group easily and move the couch around without having to select

07:47.020 --> 07:50.350
each of the objects the fabric and the wood.

07:50.490 --> 07:57.370
So I they come over here to object and come up to group and create new group and you can also use control

07:57.370 --> 07:58.160
G.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.880
So I'm going to click that.

08:00.160 --> 08:05.620
And now we have a new group and I'll come over here to the left and I'll name this I'll just call it

08:05.620 --> 08:08.840
couch and we go.

08:09.030 --> 08:15.760
And now if you look this new group does not appear over here in the outliner.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.330
This is everything we have in our scene but it isn't here.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.870
That group isn't here to be selected.

08:22.030 --> 08:28.420
And that's an odd thing about blender you have to come up here to the all seems menu item and choose

08:28.420 --> 08:31.150
groups to see your groups.

08:31.150 --> 08:36.670
So now I can select this couch and I can move it around as I need.

08:36.730 --> 08:44.770
So let me just move it around to one of the walls here and I'm also going to bring back that scale item

08:45.200 --> 08:51.130
so to slide it around on the floor what I can do is I can press the G key and then I can press shift

08:51.220 --> 08:56.110
Z and that will ensure that I cannot move it in the Z-axis up or down.

08:56.110 --> 09:00.100
So now I can slide it around on the floor wherever I want.

09:00.100 --> 09:05.440
So I want to move it over here a bit kind of put it up against this wall to get a sense of how big this

09:05.500 --> 09:07.140
area is going to be.

09:07.210 --> 09:10.120
Let's go back to the reference image and take a look.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.330
So I'm thinking the couch is going to be right over here against this wall.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.850
But there's that door.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.850
I don't need to have that door open out.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.960
I could have that open in if I wanted.

09:19.960 --> 09:26.210
But let me just put that here against this wall like that just to get a sense of that.

09:26.210 --> 09:33.370
Now it feels to me like this wall is about the size of that wall sticking out for the kitchen.

09:33.370 --> 09:39.400
I'm just going to temporarily put that here now I'm going to take this wall and maybe extend it.

09:39.400 --> 09:49.270
Let me hit the tab key to go to Edit mode control tab and choose face and then I'll hit the Z key so

09:49.270 --> 09:51.490
I can see the wire frame.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.280
I just want to pull this out.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.930
Pull that out of that to here.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.040
Maybe this will be the kitchen.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.280
OK.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.100
And hit the Z key again to go back to solid view.

10:03.100 --> 10:09.340
And I'll take this wall and I'll duplicate it with shift D and then hit the Y key to only move it in

10:09.340 --> 10:10.870
the y axis.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.820
Come out here so I'm kind of blocking out the kitchen here.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.100
All right.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.730
Now I'm going to take this wall shift did a duplicate hit the x key to make sure it's going to only

10:21.730 --> 10:25.220
move in the X-axis and I'll move this over here.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.860
Maybe something like that.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.800
So I'm kind of just getting a sense of.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.470
Is this how big I want the place to be.

10:32.470 --> 10:37.930
I feel like this is a little too much room like I don't want this much room so I'm going to move this

10:37.930 --> 10:41.320
this way and I'm going to move this this way.

10:41.320 --> 10:47.680
Now there's really no wrong answer here it's really up to you how you want your environment to be just

10:47.680 --> 10:51.720
trying to get a sense of how to fill the space.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.390
So let me clean this up a little bit.

10:54.400 --> 11:05.520
I'm just going to select this and move this face back into here and I'll select something like this

11:05.550 --> 11:08.210
and move this in just to kind of clean it up a little bit.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.220
All right.

11:10.220 --> 11:17.060
So in the next video what let's do is work on cleaning up the walls will create the baseboards for them

11:17.060 --> 11:22.120
will U-V map them and we'll bring them into unity and see how it looks there.
