WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:09.230
A U-V map that I'm really only going to U-V map a couple of the parts I'm going to U-V map this piece.

00:09.450 --> 00:14.030
One of the cushions one of the back cushions on ARM and the back.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.890
And then everything else all duplicated over again.

00:16.890 --> 00:19.560
So I don't have to reuse the map.

00:19.560 --> 00:26.460
Each of the cushions are U-V map once and then I duplicate the object you know I'm thinking I also want

00:26.460 --> 00:35.550
to smooth these guys down here but I also I think want to maybe take this edge right here and scale

00:35.550 --> 00:42.450
it in I'll just s press pass and scale that in just a smidge and then I'll click smooth over here and

00:42.450 --> 00:44.370
that'll smooth that up.

00:44.400 --> 00:51.810
So now I'm just going to take all of these and hit X and delete go back to the seven key and the five

00:51.810 --> 01:03.690
key and the Z key grab that little guy and just duplicate and hit X and then take these two and Shiff

01:03.780 --> 01:07.680
D and Y and move these back up here.

01:08.690 --> 01:10.170
Here we go.

01:10.180 --> 01:14.940
So let's start U-V mapping these all I'll begin with this one.

01:14.990 --> 01:21.340
Let's say I'll come up here to the default screen layout and I'll just click here.

01:21.530 --> 01:28.120
And instead of the default screen lay out the way I have it I'll go to U-V editing and there we go the

01:28.130 --> 01:33.780
period key to zoom in on that and to isolate this I'll press shift.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.080
H.

01:35.120 --> 01:41.930
Now one thing I need to deal with is I've still got the subdivision surface modifier on here.

01:41.930 --> 01:48.830
I need to apply that I need to bake or make permanent This geometry.

01:48.890 --> 01:56.000
You can see that the original geometry is still pretty blocky and out here I need to bake this in.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.200
So what I'm going to do I mean just while I'm in the U-V editing for you I'm just going to move this

02:00.200 --> 02:07.160
over a bit and I'm going to grab this little tab right up here and just bring that over and then I'll

02:07.160 --> 02:10.040
create a propertys panel from this.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.060
Here we go.

02:11.060 --> 02:17.640
So if I go over to my modifiers tab I can see I've got my subdivision service modifier.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.410
I've got to view it to let me see what happens at one.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.180
Not bad.

02:24.220 --> 02:33.550
I almost feel like I could move these in a bear like this and maybe even move these down a bit so it's

02:33.550 --> 02:37.100
not quite causing such a

02:40.300 --> 02:41.670
sharp edge there.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.190
Something like that.

02:44.450 --> 02:47.960
So I'll go with the one I'll hit apply.

02:48.170 --> 02:55.190
And now you can see if you hit tab that's what the cushion looks like now.

02:55.730 --> 03:00.220
Now I think I could get rid of a good deal of these polygons.

03:00.220 --> 03:06.530
I'm going to click this little guy right here to make it so I can't see through it.

03:07.330 --> 03:13.570
And I think I could probably get rid of the saw press the C key to go to the circle select tool and

03:13.570 --> 03:23.900
I'll just click and drag some of these polygons here and maybe these over here.

03:23.980 --> 03:34.300
I don't think I need most of those so I'm going to hit X and delete those faces and I don't know that

03:34.300 --> 03:39.170
I need all of these edges along here either.

03:39.190 --> 03:49.370
I'll just do this and this with alt and shift and click and then press X and choose dissolve edges.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.510
If we just deleted edges here's what would happen.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.320
That's not good.

03:54.410 --> 04:01.940
So I'll undo that with control or command Z what we need to do is dissolve the edges so I press X and

04:01.940 --> 04:03.250
dissolve edges.

04:03.440 --> 04:10.260
And that leaves the polygons there but removes the edges right.

04:10.300 --> 04:19.330
So I like doing this because I like not having to U-V map faces that aren't going to be seen so I'm

04:19.330 --> 04:21.180
just going to go with this here.

04:21.490 --> 04:28.540
I'm going to select this edge and then control click this edge and everything in between those two edges

04:28.540 --> 04:30.040
will be selected.

04:30.040 --> 04:44.890
Then I'll press control and Mark scene and same thing over here to this oh let's do this and this wraps

04:45.140 --> 04:46.770
I need to press control.

04:46.770 --> 05:00.960
There you go Mark seam and I'll do the same thing over here so this control your control easy mark scheme

05:02.180 --> 05:05.150
and then this and this.

05:05.150 --> 05:08.890
Right down here control click control.

05:08.940 --> 05:16.500
Mark seem so now that we've marked these seams we can go ahead and unwrap this but let me show you something

05:16.500 --> 05:20.630
that may happen when you try and unwrap an object like this.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.360
What can happen is you get a little error here.

05:24.570 --> 05:33.020
So I'm going to press you which brings up the U-V mapping menu and then I'm going to click unwrap.

05:33.210 --> 05:36.740
Now look up here it says object has nonuniform scale.

05:36.750 --> 05:42.930
Unwrap will operate in a scaled manner or whatever it says in other words what it's telling you is you

05:42.930 --> 05:49.800
may not be getting a good unwrap here because the transforms haven't been applied.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.370
You've got nonuniform scale.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.970
So let me show you what that means.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.150
I'm going to move this over just a bit.

05:56.280 --> 06:02.500
Press the end key and what that means is that if I tab into object mode look at the scale here.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.090
They're not all the same.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.730
When you create a new object These are all ones.

06:07.770 --> 06:14.540
So if I come over here and create a cube that cube you can see is all ones right.

06:14.610 --> 06:15.960
That's uniform scale.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.430
This is nonuniform scale.

06:18.450 --> 06:24.540
And when you have nonuniform scale you're U-V unwraps can be a little wonky.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.740
So it's something to look out for.

06:27.030 --> 06:30.220
To fix that what you can do is press control a.

06:30.420 --> 06:35.220
And now you can apply the transformations of say your rotation and scale.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.800
You can do it for the scale only and that's fine.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.520
I'm going to go ahead and hit the rotation and scale here and there we go.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.430
So now these are all ones.

06:45.490 --> 06:51.080
OK so now I'm going to hit the end key to go back and then tab into that mode.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.500
Now going to press you and unwrap that looks better.

06:55.590 --> 06:58.890
See the deal is when it has uniform scale.

06:58.920 --> 07:05.930
The U.V. map will more closely match the scale and proportion of Iran object.

07:06.270 --> 07:07.320
That looks pretty good.

07:07.350 --> 07:09.090
I'm going to go with that for now.

07:09.090 --> 07:13.900
So get a tab out of that press alt h to bring everything else back.

07:14.370 --> 07:16.720
And let's take a look at this.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.690
So I'll hit the period key to zoom into it.

07:19.850 --> 07:23.120
I'll press shift h to isolate it.

07:23.550 --> 07:31.540
And let's take a look and see if we can apply our subdivision surface modifier here.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.310
I'll take it down to one again.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.020
And that still looks pretty good.

07:36.070 --> 07:37.950
I'll go ahead and hit apply.

07:38.070 --> 07:40.330
And now let's take a look at it.

07:40.710 --> 07:46.080
Let's go ahead and see if we can take away some of these faces.

07:46.230 --> 07:50.160
So I'm going to take these away right down here.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.180
I don't think we need these.

07:52.240 --> 07:57.580
Now I'll just make my life a little easier as I try and unwrap this.

07:58.090 --> 08:00.120
Well I think we need these down here.

08:00.130 --> 08:01.080
Do we.

08:01.170 --> 08:06.790
Well you might see these Let me give those back.

08:06.790 --> 08:07.140
All right.

08:07.150 --> 08:13.760
Let's go and delete this and see what happens x and delete faces.

08:13.780 --> 08:15.100
All right.

08:15.100 --> 08:21.020
I'm going to press alt H again and make sure I've haven't taken away anything that I need.

08:21.030 --> 08:25.020
No I think that looks pretty good so I'll select that again.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.360
Shift H.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.810
I think I can even take one more row here right here.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.280
Yeah.

08:34.530 --> 08:35.580
And here we go.

08:35.580 --> 08:41.200
All right so now making my life easier when it comes to U-V mapping.

08:41.210 --> 08:41.940
I like it.

08:42.180 --> 08:51.300
I think what I'll do is I'll begin here and control click their control earmarks seem.

08:51.850 --> 08:52.530
Yeah.

08:52.810 --> 08:53.920
It was here was it.

08:53.920 --> 08:58.870
So control click control earmarks seem.

08:58.930 --> 09:01.900
And down here really we only need one.

09:01.900 --> 09:08.310
I think maybe here in here control and Mark seem so now we hit a disliked everything.

09:08.440 --> 09:18.370
Oh let's before we do this take a look at our scale tab and yep sure enough nonuniform scale so in Object

09:18.370 --> 09:22.420
mode all press control a rotation scale.

09:22.420 --> 09:29.750
Now I've got all ones and zeros tab back into edit mode and press you and unwrap.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.170
Oh yeah that's looking good.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.200
All right alt h.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.610
Let's take a look at something else here.

09:36.630 --> 09:38.050
How about this guy down here.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.300
Let's take a look at this shift.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.390
H.

09:41.710 --> 09:42.210
Period.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.840
To frame it up.

09:44.200 --> 09:49.710
And now we're not going to need the faces back here.

09:49.930 --> 09:53.540
But let's go ahead and take the view down to one see if we can.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.060
Yeah we can use that.

09:55.060 --> 09:55.680
All right.

09:55.720 --> 10:05.050
So apply that tab into object mode and let's start removing some of these faces we just don't need all

10:05.050 --> 10:06.320
of this back here.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.700
Something like this.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.510
Right x faces.

10:13.350 --> 10:14.190
How about down here.

10:14.190 --> 10:15.920
We don't need all of this do we.

10:18.100 --> 10:23.290
Nope faces delete those.

10:24.110 --> 10:25.950
What about the ones on the sides.

10:25.980 --> 10:30.630
All it takes to bring everything we don't need those on the sides either do we.

10:31.410 --> 10:34.740
Now so shift h.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.270
Let's take those away.

10:36.270 --> 10:41.980
Heck do we even need these up top let's take a look.

10:42.070 --> 10:42.810
H.

10:43.680 --> 10:49.530
Well you can kind of see through some in here but on back I don't think we do.

10:50.610 --> 10:54.120
All right well that makes our life a little easier.

10:54.120 --> 11:05.480
So if we just take away if we just took away this whole thing and then press alt shift and click on

11:05.480 --> 11:09.650
an edge right between two of the faces and that didn't do me any good.

11:09.650 --> 11:11.390
Now let's try that again.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.470
Allt click.

11:13.670 --> 11:14.170
Man.

11:14.180 --> 11:14.560
All right.

11:14.570 --> 11:20.250
So all to click an edge between two of the faces and get rid of those are right.

11:20.390 --> 11:29.540
So I'll hit X and faces and then I want to hit the Z key and border select all of this so I'll press

11:29.720 --> 11:32.830
B and click and drag here.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.380
X and faces.

11:36.410 --> 11:37.850
All right.

11:37.850 --> 11:42.290
So yeah that doesn't look too bad.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.090
Can we even get rid of this.

11:45.090 --> 11:49.000
Here to alt click that.

11:49.170 --> 11:54.260
Well let's try that be nice if I could get rid of all of that.

11:54.340 --> 11:54.880
H

11:58.670 --> 11:59.590
Yeah.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.770
Why not.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.870
Let's just get rid of all that.

12:04.070 --> 12:05.620
Nice.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.240
All right.

12:06.410 --> 12:07.360
Shift h.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.110
Let's take a look at it.

12:09.160 --> 12:16.120
You know since it's just one sided I think we could just unwrap it as is.

12:16.120 --> 12:23.650
We don't need to create any seems or anything so I'll tab back into object mode press control a click

12:23.680 --> 12:30.890
rotation and scale tab back into edit mode you and unwrap.

12:30.910 --> 12:33.100
Now let's take a look down here.

12:33.160 --> 12:38.380
When you unwrap something and before you click anything or anything you can come over here and try a

12:38.380 --> 12:39.880
different method out.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.940
I'm currently using angle base but let's try conformal

12:46.150 --> 12:48.730
doesn't really help us much.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.020
I'll go with that.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.140
That looks OK.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.580
All right old age to bring that back.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.180
What haven't we done yet.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.210
We haven't done this yet.

12:59.220 --> 12:59.780
Right.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.570
All right so let's try that all shift.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.960
H that and isolate it.

13:07.290 --> 13:18.200
Now let's think about this let's take the view in the subdivision service modifier down to one.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.790
See how that looks.

13:20.510 --> 13:29.900
I think that will work I'll hit apply tab into edit mode and for this we could get rid of some at the

13:29.900 --> 13:34.450
back and inside there make sure I know which way is which.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.450
OK.

13:35.450 --> 13:41.390
So this is the back and this is the inside right.

13:41.410 --> 13:44.290
We could even get rid of some on the bottom I think.

13:44.290 --> 13:48.910
I don't think I'm going to be turning this couch over any and the scene.

13:48.940 --> 13:49.360
All right.

13:49.360 --> 13:57.640
I'm going to isolate it edit mode and press the C key and I'll just start taking some of these out and

13:57.640 --> 14:00.950
seeing what we can get away with.

14:01.890 --> 14:04.960
And if I take too many we can always undo it.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.780
I'll hit X and faces.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.230
Yeah.

14:09.410 --> 14:13.210
OK let's try these here.

14:13.230 --> 14:13.810
All right.

14:13.810 --> 14:14.330
There's that.

14:14.350 --> 14:17.230
I'll go ahead and take those out.

14:17.700 --> 14:29.230
And then on the inside let's do this we go to get these little ones I'm going to press the Z key and

14:29.230 --> 14:34.360
then B to board or select these and delete these.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.840
All right.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.900
Let's take a look at what we got.

14:37.930 --> 14:40.480
Press alt H.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.190
Did we run it for anything.

14:42.190 --> 14:46.580
No I think we're pretty good yeah.

14:46.850 --> 14:50.460
OK so let's try and map this.

14:50.570 --> 14:57.020
Once again I'll press control a and rotation and scale to apply the transforms Alt-Tab tab into edit

14:57.020 --> 15:05.050
mode and let's go ahead and mark a few seems here I think maybe just right around here would be fine.

15:05.090 --> 15:09.430
Yeah let's try and control the marks seem.

15:09.850 --> 15:14.870
Hit the A key and then hit the key and unwrap.

15:14.890 --> 15:25.950
Not too bad about conformal angle based Keralite conformal a little bit better.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.100
Let's go with that.
