WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:09.150
Well now we have our two U-V maps ready to go for our coffee table if we come over here to the materials

00:09.150 --> 00:13.260
panel and we select the word and choose select in edit mode.

00:13.260 --> 00:20.400
We get our U-V map for the world and if we then select that and select the table top and select that

00:20.430 --> 00:22.850
we get the U.V. map for the top there.

00:22.980 --> 00:28.130
Let's take each of these out into Photoshop and texture them.

00:28.410 --> 00:39.680
So I'll come down here to Uvas go to export U-V lay out browse to my textures folder and here will call

00:39.680 --> 00:50.260
this will create a new folder and we'll call this coffee table and in here we'll put our coffee table

00:50.410 --> 00:58.760
top movies right there and notice that this is at 10:24 I'm going to go ahead and leave that at 10:24

00:58.760 --> 01:05.710
by 10:24 for now we can always save out of Photoshop at a smaller resolution if needed.

01:05.780 --> 01:08.210
But I'll go ahead and export that out.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.920
Now I can de-select this.

01:09.920 --> 01:17.380
Select the material of the wood select that and let's go ahead and export these out as well.

01:17.390 --> 01:18.400
Export U-V.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.410
Lay out 10:24.

01:21.430 --> 01:30.220
Let's put it in our textures coffee table and we'll put this we'll call this coffee table would underscore

01:30.230 --> 01:32.350
Uvas.

01:32.610 --> 01:33.410
All right.

01:33.660 --> 01:40.380
So now we have that exported out so we can open it in Photoshop here in Photoshop or just go to File

01:40.890 --> 01:45.180
Open and I'll browse to that textures folder.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.800
Here's my coffee table.

01:46.810 --> 01:51.890
I'll go ahead and open up both of these open.

01:52.030 --> 01:52.630
And there we go.

01:52.630 --> 01:57.450
So now let's work on the wood one here since we have that up.

01:57.520 --> 02:04.450
I'll just press Z and drag to zoom in I'll change this layer over here to call it Uvas So we know what

02:04.450 --> 02:05.530
that is.

02:05.530 --> 02:15.150
And now it's time for us to find a woodgrain texture so we can go to Google images and see if we can

02:15.150 --> 02:24.860
find wood grain texture seamless.

02:24.880 --> 02:25.670
Let's try that.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.280
Not too bad.

02:28.370 --> 02:35.360
I'm going to click on search tools go to size and large and I want something more like this.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.160
That's not bad.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.650
This isn't bad.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.130
Yeah let me try something like this.

02:41.150 --> 02:48.200
So now I'm going to press control or command a control or command C to copy and I'll come over here.

02:49.380 --> 02:58.570
To the would you use and paste it with control or command VI or drag that down beneath the movies.

02:59.040 --> 03:06.330
Hit the Wii key to my transform tool I'm going to click up here to show transform control so I can see

03:06.330 --> 03:12.570
the little handles here and press shift and click and drag and move this down like this so maybe if

03:12.570 --> 03:20.990
I do something like this that woodgrain might be small enough for this.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.530
Yeah let's try that.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.930
So I'll hit my transform tool.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.620
Allt shift and click and I'll begin going through the process of copying snapping moving over one pixel

03:37.000 --> 03:46.410
to try and build up the woodgrain for this U-V map and with all of these selected I'll do the same thing

03:46.410 --> 03:53.090
with alt shift bring down snap and move it up a pixel same down here.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.250
And just fill this whole thing with woodgrain

04:03.640 --> 04:04.430
right.

04:04.880 --> 04:13.250
So now you can see that I've got all the woodgrain going in the same direction which was easy and that's

04:13.250 --> 04:18.080
why I aligned all of the U-V islands up and down so I could do that.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.360
So before we collapse all these down or merge all the layers.

04:22.490 --> 04:26.040
Let's test it out and make sure it looks OK.

04:26.330 --> 04:30.950
So I can come up here to file export and export as.

04:30.950 --> 04:34.890
Or once again shift all control or command w.

04:35.630 --> 04:37.060
So I'll do that.

04:37.480 --> 04:46.920
And let's export this out and let's call this coffee table would underscore see for color map and let's

04:46.920 --> 04:55.600
test it out so I'll go over to Blendr here and for the material for the would appear in the note editor

04:55.600 --> 05:01.300
I'll press shift a I'll choose texture and image texture.

05:02.500 --> 05:07.320
And I'll click open and I'll browse to find that color map.

05:07.320 --> 05:07.800
There it is.

05:07.800 --> 05:18.120
Underscore see what's come down here and select the texture viewport shading and see how we did.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.290
It's not too bad.

05:19.440 --> 05:25.770
That looks sufficiently cheap and that's what I'm going for here.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.930
But it looks a little too clean.

05:27.930 --> 05:35.560
So yes I'm going to find one of my grunge maps and layered on top of that because that's just too plain.

05:35.790 --> 05:42.090
Let's go back to photoshop and let me open up one of my grungy maps.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.840
I've got a few here.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.210
So let's take a look.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.320
Yeah use that one earlier.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.070
That's not bad and it has kind of a wood grain quality to it.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.670
That's not bad.

05:54.720 --> 06:01.500
Let me go with this one here that for some reason speaks to me control or command a control and command

06:01.500 --> 06:02.630
see.

06:02.670 --> 06:08.030
Let's go back to the word and I'll paste it.

06:08.130 --> 06:15.140
I'll turn on the U-V islands here and let's maybe bring this down a bit it's kind of big you can see

06:15.720 --> 06:21.750
I'm going to bring this down to something maybe I'll just try and once again put it over the whole thing.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.420
Let's try this sometimes this just works.

06:24.420 --> 06:36.030
I'll change the blending mode to multiply and I'll reduce the opacity Let's try that OK let's try that.

06:36.030 --> 06:44.730
I'm going to save and for this I'm going to save it as a PSEG once again and I'm going to just remove

06:44.730 --> 06:53.710
these here so I'll save it as a coffee table would Steve and we go and now I'll go and export it out

06:53.950 --> 06:54.460
right here.

06:54.460 --> 07:07.670
Export as save it again overnight it and let's come back to blender and re reopen it now when we do

07:07.670 --> 07:14.840
this using unity it's going to be easier because Unity actually auto updates when you bring in or when

07:14.840 --> 07:17.880
you replace a file.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.170
So here we go.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.540
That's not too bad.

07:20.540 --> 07:25.850
It's looking a little grungy or yeah I think for now I'll go with that.

07:25.850 --> 07:31.600
All right so now we need the top to be kind of a formica finish.

07:31.610 --> 07:36.380
Let's go back to photoshop and take a look at that other U-V map.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.880
All right over here let's take a look at this one.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.730
Now this is the table top.

07:40.730 --> 07:43.860
Let's go through the same process call this Uvas.

07:44.300 --> 07:50.590
And for this let's see if we can find another material that looks kind of like what I'm after.

07:51.510 --> 07:57.460
So here I've searched for for Micah's seamless textures just to see what I come up with.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.980
I'm not seeing much that I like.

08:01.050 --> 08:09.410
Here we go this is something that I'm kind of looking for this kind of very faint texture to it.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.980
Yeah I think I want to go with this.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.700
Here it is opened up in Photoshop.

08:14.790 --> 08:18.990
Copy it just like we did before and pasted in here.

08:19.060 --> 08:28.400
All dragged down beneath the movies and let's scale it down so it fits on here.

08:31.110 --> 08:40.430
And we go so alt shift click and drag snap and do it one more time here.

08:41.870 --> 08:42.190
All right.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.140
So let's test this out.

08:44.850 --> 08:49.980
I think I'm going to want a little bit more dirt on it and maybe some stains.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.210
But let's test this out and see how it looks.

08:52.230 --> 09:00.130
There's a repeatable pattern right here or a visible repetition that I'm not fond of right here.

09:00.270 --> 09:03.410
We might need to take care of that.

09:03.420 --> 09:13.830
I think what I'll do is I will hit the I key to sample and then come over to the brush tool and let's

09:13.830 --> 09:21.210
go ahead and combine these layers over here with control or command E and now with my brush tool I'll

09:21.210 --> 09:25.530
change it to something that has a soft edge to it.

09:26.560 --> 09:36.820
And when you increase the size a bit it's that opacity 100 let's take this down to 50 percent to do

09:36.820 --> 09:37.120
that.

09:37.120 --> 09:46.450
You can just hit the five key on the keyboard for opacity and shift 5 for flow and then I'll just come

09:46.450 --> 09:55.270
in here and begin kind of breaking up the pattern just a little bit so it doesn't look quite so continuous

09:55.270 --> 09:57.630
or or repetitive.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.920
All right there we go.

10:00.590 --> 10:02.540
So let's test this out.

10:03.550 --> 10:10.570
Let's go to export and we'll export this one out as well so these are just tests right now.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.070
We'll clean these up here in a minute.

10:13.070 --> 10:23.400
Let me go back to Blendr and let's select this material the table top and let us in the note editor

10:23.410 --> 10:29.710
bring our texture in here with shift a texture image texture open.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.660
And here is the coffee table top.

10:32.910 --> 10:34.150
And there we go.

10:34.150 --> 10:38.200
So yeah I think that's going to work pretty well.

10:38.940 --> 10:43.830
What I want to do though is to create a few stains on the top here.

10:43.830 --> 10:50.880
All right so I've opened these up in Photoshop just go ahead and copy them and take them over to that

10:50.880 --> 10:52.710
table top.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.350
And they're kind of big which is fine.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.620
I'll shrink this down a bit.

10:58.760 --> 11:03.590
Let's see if we can put this in place and kind of blended in.

11:04.930 --> 11:13.420
So maybe a coffee cup would be about this big let's say and now what I can do is come in and reduce

11:14.020 --> 11:15.640
the opacity a bit.

11:15.760 --> 11:22.290
I can try and change it to multiply but I don't think that's going to really help a linear burn.

11:22.290 --> 11:22.850
Let's see.

11:22.850 --> 11:27.490
No that's a little too much so I'll just take the opacity down.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.660
Something like that.

11:30.520 --> 11:35.440
And then let's come in with the erase tool.

11:35.620 --> 11:41.980
And once again I've got the opacity at 50 and the flow at 50 and I'm just going to kind of erase the

11:41.980 --> 11:44.610
edges around here a bit.

11:45.460 --> 11:52.210
And I'm also going to come in and take this stained one that one that I thought maybe might work well

11:52.210 --> 11:53.710
just over the whole thing.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.680
Put that underneath here.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.950
And let's see if we can put that over the whole thing.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.370
I'll turn the UVA's back on.

12:05.690 --> 12:12.710
Drag that over the whole thing just to get a general state of nastiness over that.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.790
And let's reduce the opacity a bit.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.500
Something like that.

12:22.700 --> 12:30.150
And then we can come back and work with this I'll increase the opacity just a little bit here.

12:30.320 --> 12:37.900
So it looks kind of gross and then maybe come back with the Eraste tool and try and get rid of some

12:37.900 --> 12:40.200
of those edges there.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.060
Right.

12:41.340 --> 12:46.370
Let's bring in that other coffee mug stain here.

12:47.020 --> 12:50.620
And for this one maybe I'll put it over on the other side.

12:55.970 --> 13:01.220
All right so now that we have our texture map done here in Photoshop Let's go ahead and clean up these

13:01.220 --> 13:02.230
U-V maps.

13:02.510 --> 13:11.240
Well let's do is go to the magic wand tool over here or the W key and I'm going to select the Uvas layer

13:11.630 --> 13:19.100
click to select everything around the U-V island go to select modify contract and maybe bring it back

13:19.190 --> 13:25.190
to pixels or so I can take all of these and merge them down into one layer.

13:25.190 --> 13:31.430
And I think actually what I'm going to do is just to be safe I'm going to select all of these and press

13:31.520 --> 13:39.920
alt and click and copy these and then press control or command e to then collapse them all so that I

13:39.920 --> 13:46.760
can hide these these are my original layers and if I ever want to come back here and modify it I can

13:46.760 --> 13:47.980
do that here.

13:48.030 --> 13:57.420
Now I can select these and put them in a group or a folder and I can just call these originals.

13:58.130 --> 14:04.270
And you go so just so I don't lose what I've done now that I have this.

14:04.310 --> 14:12.600
And the movies or the outside of the movie islands selected I'll just delete that controlled or commanded

14:12.670 --> 14:23.350
to de-select create a new layer make sure it's black hat g for the bucket tool and put that back there.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.290
So now we have a texture map for the top.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.990
Export it out and then we go

14:34.210 --> 14:36.640
and let's come over here to this one.

14:36.640 --> 14:43.970
Let's go ahead and select the UVA's hit the W key and select outside the U-V islands.

14:44.500 --> 14:50.880
I will contract these with select modify contract to pixel's.

14:50.880 --> 14:55.620
Now I'm going to go and take all of these and collapse them down.

14:55.620 --> 15:03.200
I don't think I need all of those so control were command E and we'll call this word we'll call this

15:03.200 --> 15:05.470
Solaire grunge.

15:05.470 --> 15:14.770
And now I can select the grunge layer and hit delete the wood layer delete and then create a new layer

15:14.770 --> 15:24.330
behind all of this hit G for the paint bucket tool control command d to de-select everything and paint

15:24.370 --> 15:27.070
right back there on that back layer.

15:27.070 --> 15:30.660
So now there are our texture maps.

15:30.820 --> 15:35.990
So let's export this one out to and this is the wood right.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.190
The wood color.

15:37.220 --> 15:37.580
All right.

15:37.580 --> 15:38.650
Let's do that.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.130
And replace.

15:41.140 --> 15:41.880
There we go.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.530
Let's go back to blender and see how it looks.

15:44.530 --> 15:45.190
Here we are.

15:45.190 --> 15:50.880
I will go ahead and replace this one with the coffee table top.

15:51.130 --> 15:53.800
Ooh that looks disgusting I like it.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.580
And I'll go ahead and replace the bottom one.

15:57.580 --> 16:03.960
The wood here with our cleaned up texture right here.

16:04.750 --> 16:05.810
And there we go.

16:06.220 --> 16:10.030
So there we have our textured coffee table.

16:10.240 --> 16:16.210
What we'll do next is take it into unity and see if the materials look any different than we had before

16:16.600 --> 16:17.290
with the couch.
