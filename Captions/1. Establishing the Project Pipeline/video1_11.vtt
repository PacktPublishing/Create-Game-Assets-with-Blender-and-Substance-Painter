00:00.750 --> 00:08.370
Well I've gone ahead and added the baseboards U-V mapped all the walls and added the materials for both

00:08.490 --> 00:12.780
the baseboard and the main part of the wall.

00:12.840 --> 00:17.990
There are a couple of things I want to do before I take this all into unity and see how it works.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.710
I'd like to get the naming conventions pretty much the same between the material and the object itself.

00:23.760 --> 00:31.830
So if I select this wall back here this back wall of the kitchen and press the End key I can come down

00:31.830 --> 00:37.530
here and see that this wall is called Wall back 0 0 2 you can see it here in the outliner.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.540
What I want to do is make sure that it's called the same as it's main material.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.750
So here in the materials panel I'll just select that press control or command see and then paste this

00:48.750 --> 00:49.720
here.

00:50.130 --> 00:59.610
And for this one I've got a wall kitchen left and baseboard kitchen left and it is kitchen left but

00:59.610 --> 01:01.670
it's also a living room right.

01:01.670 --> 01:08.880
So why don't I call this center instead of kitchen left.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.450
Just change that here.

01:12.820 --> 01:16.260
And naming is a big thing actually.

01:16.390 --> 01:24.730
Once you get a fairly complex project going in blender in Unity your naming conventions and your organization

01:24.730 --> 01:26.340
is actually pretty important.

01:26.580 --> 01:33.140
So I'm going to change this as well to center just so I know what that is.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.790
So I'll select that name from the Tiriel copy.

01:36.850 --> 01:39.940
And let's paste it right here.

01:40.910 --> 01:43.670
This one let's make sure we've got this correct.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.430
This is Wall living room back.

01:46.450 --> 01:47.150
Yeah.

01:47.670 --> 01:55.380
And I'll just go through and make sure that all of the names of the walls are the same as the main material.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.820
Name.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.030
It's just going to help me out.

01:59.210 --> 02:06.450
Once we get everything into unity now that I have everything named you can see that I've also created

02:06.670 --> 02:13.830
a template object for the windows that should go here along the wall I've just duplicated the door template

02:13.860 --> 02:16.460
and brought it over here to the window wall.

02:16.620 --> 02:22.680
And if I select that wall you can see I've already gone ahead and inserted the edge loops like we did

02:22.680 --> 02:27.910
around the doors all turn off this layer so we can't see the template.

02:27.930 --> 02:36.800
And I'm just going to go ahead and select these faces and get rid of these the same way we did the doors

02:39.120 --> 02:48.300
and I'll also take one of these windows select the edges here centered up with the period key.

02:48.300 --> 02:53.900
I'll go ahead and press control E and choose bridge edge loops.

02:53.910 --> 03:00.240
Now with that still selected I'll hit the P key to separate to that by selection.

03:00.270 --> 03:02.660
Now it is its own object.

03:02.700 --> 03:08.010
I can then take that and select the edges around here.

03:08.010 --> 03:15.980
Scale them out a bit x x and I can extrude up press the e key and hit enter and then what I'll do is

03:16.070 --> 03:21.270
scale out in just the y and z axes so I'll press.

03:21.280 --> 03:29.690
As for scale and then shift x to make sure I do not scale in the x axis and then I'll just expand these

03:29.690 --> 03:30.600
out just a bit.

03:30.620 --> 03:38.020
We're going to need to do some extra scaling here so now I'll go s z and bring these back in a bit.

03:38.360 --> 03:47.930
So they kind of match the sides there and then I will scale these in toward each other so we enter x

03:48.050 --> 03:51.120
x scale them in towards each other.

03:51.140 --> 03:57.900
So they intersect with the wall they're in there we've got a basic window frame.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.610
The pivot point is down here.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.900
Let's set the origin to the geometry.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.860
There it is.

04:03.090 --> 04:10.620
And maybe I'll just shrink it in just a little bit here I'll hit s shift x and then press the shift

04:10.620 --> 04:18.610
key to scale and just a little tiny bit now I can come over here and hit the three key the five key

04:18.610 --> 04:30.940
the Z key and now I'll just press shift D and Y and move this over shift d y and move this over.

04:30.960 --> 04:38.160
All right I'll hit the Z key to go back to solid shading five key to go back to perspective and then

04:38.160 --> 04:41.050
we've got the basics of our windows.

04:41.090 --> 04:49.440
I've still got to put the double hung frames in the window sill here beneath the window and ultimately

04:49.440 --> 04:56.220
I'll probably put some sort of blinds or curtains that hang down so we can't see out the windows too

04:56.220 --> 04:57.900
easily.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.310
All right.

04:58.320 --> 05:04.250
Well you know what we should do is we should go ahead and U-V map these before we take anything into

05:04.290 --> 05:10.360
Unity's so we can include these along so I guess I don't need these right yet.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.800
I'll go ahead and delete those.

05:12.860 --> 05:21.090
I'll use the map this one and then all duplicated over so I'll press shift h and then period to center

05:21.090 --> 05:21.900
it up.

05:22.260 --> 05:30.510
And I guess I'll just split it out like this let's just let's just press alt and click this edge and

05:30.540 --> 05:40.110
alt shift and click these edges here let's press control E and Mark scheme and then let's also be sure

05:40.110 --> 05:45.440
and remember in object mode press control a and rotation and scale.

05:45.840 --> 05:53.610
So now if we go to our U-V editing screen lay out and go to Edit mode let's select everything you and

05:53.650 --> 05:58.550
unwrap and then we go that looks pretty good.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.150
All right.

05:59.390 --> 06:07.330
So now that we have that U-V map let's go back alt h to bring everything back and then let's go through

06:07.330 --> 06:16.890
that process one more time of just copying that over.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.400
All right so now let's give this a try LIT's.

06:19.780 --> 06:27.550
I'm going to just turn on the first layer where all of our wall door window objects are I'll hit the

06:27.580 --> 06:34.570
A key to select all of these and I'll come up here do file and export and SBX.

06:34.750 --> 06:41.470
I'll be sure and check selected objects and I'll put this in my exports folder.

06:41.470 --> 06:45.970
And let's call this let's just call this walls.

06:45.970 --> 06:52.470
Let's give it a try export SBX and then we go.

06:52.820 --> 06:55.640
Let's go over to unity here in Unity.

06:55.640 --> 07:01.550
I will open up a Finder window and let's go back to our exports folder.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.680
And here is our walls FBA X-File.

07:04.940 --> 07:05.440
I'll take it.

07:05.450 --> 07:10.710
I'll drag it into the scene drop it into the assets folder and there it is.

07:10.710 --> 07:18.330
So now if we look at our materials folder now that we've dropped that in look at all of the materials

07:18.390 --> 07:19.830
that it's brought along.

07:20.220 --> 07:20.620
Right.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.920
So let's drag this in.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.370
I'll just take this and drag this into the hierarchy.

07:25.970 --> 07:26.760
And there we go.

07:26.760 --> 07:35.460
So there is the walls of our apartment now select that couch and I'll just click on the green part of

07:35.460 --> 07:40.650
the gizmo here to slide it around on the floor and I'll bring that over here and put it maybe against

07:40.650 --> 07:47.370
the wall here just so we get a sense of how that is going to look and if we take a look at one of our

07:47.370 --> 07:49.490
walls I'll just select this one here.

07:49.560 --> 07:55.790
Click on it one more time and that selects that individual wall within the FBI X group that came in.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.750
You can see that within that one wall.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.230
I'm going to press the F key to zoom in and frame it up here.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.780
You can see that within that one object of the wall.

08:06.780 --> 08:10.290
We have two materials.

08:10.350 --> 08:13.280
So we've done this two ways.

08:13.270 --> 08:19.580
Now one we've brought in a collection of objects each with its own material.

08:19.650 --> 08:26.770
The next one we brought in a collection of objects and each object has multiple materials.

08:26.790 --> 08:34.670
The next thing we'll do is we'll take a look at how to bring in an object with multiple materials and

08:34.680 --> 08:36.780
multiple U-V maps.

08:36.780 --> 08:46.740
So so far with the walls we've just had one U-V map for all of the cases that make up each material.

08:46.740 --> 08:55.080
What we'll do the next time the next object we bring in will actually have all one object multiple materials

08:55.560 --> 08:58.780
and a U-V map for each of those materials.

08:59.040 --> 09:06.510
But before we get to that I just want to run around our apartment and see how it feels so I'm just going

09:06.510 --> 09:08.400
to hit the play button here.

09:10.350 --> 09:17.610
And once again with WASC and the mouse I'm going to run around and whoa really quickly I'm going to

09:17.610 --> 09:26.810
run around really fast and take a look at how this feels so we look at our wall and that's not bad.

09:26.980 --> 09:37.510
Our Windows our door it's feelin pretty good like it's an actual space that we could walk around in.

09:37.990 --> 09:40.120
Yeah I think this will work.

09:40.240 --> 09:48.580
I think I might want to adjust the speed of my movement here so I'm going to select that player and

09:48.580 --> 09:56.230
come over here to the movement settings and the forward speed is 8 right now let me go let me take that

09:56.230 --> 09:57.370
down by half.

09:57.370 --> 10:01.120
I'll go for and let's see how that works.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.360
I'll hit play again.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.050
And that that's a little bit better.

10:06.050 --> 10:10.730
I was moving around a little bit more now of course we can run right through the walls now.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.220
Right.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.150
We don't have colliders on them.

10:13.380 --> 10:18.210
We can of course put colliders on these if we wanted to do that.

10:18.220 --> 10:27.640
All we have to do is just select one of the walls and choose add component physics box Collider and

10:27.640 --> 10:29.150
there we go.

10:29.170 --> 10:36.400
Now we can also take all of these and create box colliders for them all at once so if I like this wall

10:36.520 --> 10:43.030
let's say this wall and this and this and this and this.

10:43.030 --> 10:49.840
Now I could come up here to add component physics box Collider and now we've got colliders on all of

10:49.840 --> 10:53.790
the walls so if I hit play and I run real hard at it.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.600
If I can't go through it.

10:57.610 --> 10:58.960
There we go.

10:58.980 --> 10:59.840
All right.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.600
So we're looking pretty good.

11:02.820 --> 11:10.200
So in the next video what let's do is work on an object where as I mentioned we have multiple materials

11:10.740 --> 11:13.370
and a map for each of the materials.
