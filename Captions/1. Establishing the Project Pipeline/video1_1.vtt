00:00.700 --> 00:07.690
This is Darren Lyle and welcome to creating a game environment in Blendr and unity in this course.

00:07.700 --> 00:16.200
What I'd like to do is work on creating a project an interior apartment scene that uses blender and

00:16.200 --> 00:20.330
unity in kind of an integrated way from the very beginning.

00:20.460 --> 00:30.360
I've seen a lot of course that go over creating game objects in Blender modeling U.V. mapping maybe

00:30.360 --> 00:31.860
even texturing.

00:31.860 --> 00:37.560
And then at the end they say and then you take it into unity or I've seen a lot of courses where it's

00:37.560 --> 00:43.740
about unity and all the assets have already been made and you're bringing them in it into unity at the

00:43.740 --> 00:46.670
beginning and then going from there.

00:46.830 --> 00:53.270
What I'd like to do is show you how I kind of use Blender in unity from the very beginning of the project.

00:53.370 --> 00:59.850
I think it's important to be able to go back and forth easily and quickly between the two programs as

00:59.850 --> 01:01.760
you create your environment.

01:01.770 --> 01:07.920
It's the way I do it and hopefully what you can get out of it is maybe some ideas that you can apply

01:07.920 --> 01:09.800
to your process.

01:09.810 --> 01:12.720
So having said that here we are in Blender.

01:12.840 --> 01:19.740
I think the first thing we should do is take a look at our scale and what unit of measure we're going

01:19.740 --> 01:21.880
to be using throughout the project.

01:21.900 --> 01:30.630
So Blendr by default when you first open it up has these Blendr units that come over here to the scene

01:30.750 --> 01:38.950
button and you can see here under units we've got none which is the default Blendr unit.

01:39.150 --> 01:44.700
And then you've got metric and the imperial system of inches and feet.

01:44.700 --> 01:50.900
I'm here in America and so I am surrounded by the imperial system of inches and feet.

01:51.030 --> 01:56.460
If you're anywhere else in the world then you're probably using the metric system.

01:56.760 --> 02:03.120
Now Unity's basic unit of measure is the metric system is one meter.

02:03.120 --> 02:10.290
So if I switch here in Blendr from none to metric you can see that not much happens.

02:10.290 --> 02:13.970
You go back from none metric.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.890
There really isn't any difference.

02:15.900 --> 02:22.590
However if you switch over to the imperial system you can see that the grid switches two feet and the

02:22.590 --> 02:24.140
grid shrinks a bit.

02:24.390 --> 02:28.220
But ultimately it's still the same size.

02:28.230 --> 02:30.870
This cube is still the same size.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.580
So let's take a look at it.

02:32.580 --> 02:39.900
I'm going to press the End key to bring up the properties panel here and if I go up scroll up a bit

02:39.960 --> 02:48.260
you can see I've got location rotation and scale and then I've got dimensions here and Jered dimensions

02:48.270 --> 02:51.540
you can see that this cube is two meters by two meters.

02:51.540 --> 03:00.570
Now if I switch it if I switch from metric to Imperial you can see that it switches to 6.5 six two feet

03:00.810 --> 03:03.370
which is two meters.

03:03.450 --> 03:10.700
So the size of your objects don't change when you switch your units of measure.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.460
You're just measuring the size in a different way.

03:14.460 --> 03:19.690
But to make things easier we should probably use the metric system.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.480
Now if we open up unity I'm going to go ahead and open up unity here.

03:26.080 --> 03:33.100
And I'm going to go ahead and create a new project and I will call this I'll just call it unity.

03:33.160 --> 03:38.920
So I know it's a unity project folder and then I'll just call this apartment because I'm going to be

03:38.920 --> 03:48.190
creating an interior apartment scene here and I'll just make sure that using 3-D instead of 2D.

03:48.190 --> 03:51.550
Just click on 3D there and create project.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.920
So here we are in unity.

03:53.920 --> 04:00.100
Now if I come over here and right click in the hierarchy I can create a 3D object and I'll just create

04:00.220 --> 04:05.520
a cube and make sure that this is in the center of the grid.

04:05.520 --> 04:13.190
It is the position is 0 0 0 over here in the inspector to move around in Unity is a little bit different

04:13.190 --> 04:24.270
than Blendr you mainly use the alt key and then click and drag it to tumble Allt middle mouse button

04:24.270 --> 04:32.670
to Pan and Allt right mouse button to zoom and you can also scroll the mouse wheel to zoom as well so

04:32.670 --> 04:35.080
it's a little bit different navigation.

04:35.090 --> 04:37.590
But you kind of get used to it after a while.

04:37.620 --> 04:44.820
If you've ever used Autodesk Maya it's the exact same way of navigating within the 3D view.

04:44.820 --> 04:53.160
In addition if you want to move or rotate or scale it's a little different than Blendr you can always

04:53.160 --> 05:02.580
come up here and choose the move rotate and scale tools right up here or you can press w for move E-4

05:02.610 --> 05:05.640
rotate and are for scale.

05:05.790 --> 05:11.450
So that allows you to switch quickly with the W E and Archy's.

05:11.460 --> 05:16.360
All right so this cube is actually one meter by one meter.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.070
So let's do a little test here.

05:18.150 --> 05:26.700
Let's test taking a cube from Blender into unity and make sure our pipeline is working the way we want

05:26.700 --> 05:27.870
it to.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.160
All right.

05:28.170 --> 05:31.170
So we have one by one cube here.

05:31.170 --> 05:31.680
That's good.

05:31.680 --> 05:37.110
I'm going to switch back to Blender here and let's change the dimensions of this cube.

05:37.110 --> 05:45.360
I'm just going to come into the dimensions field here and type in one tab one tab one and enter.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.970
And so now we have a cube that is one meter by one meter.

05:49.980 --> 05:50.430
All right.

05:50.430 --> 05:51.640
I'm going to call this.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.610
I'm going to name this cube.

05:53.850 --> 06:01.480
I'm going to call this blender cube for the name of it.

06:01.710 --> 06:07.230
And in addition what I'm going to do is add a material to it I'm going to come over here to the materials

06:07.230 --> 06:11.100
panel and it already has a default material.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.700
Now I'm using the cycle's render engine.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.580
I just have that on by default whenever I create a new blender scene.

06:19.620 --> 06:26.310
But if you're using the blender render engine here that's fine too it doesn't really matter because

06:26.400 --> 06:33.460
our final materials and our final rendering are going to take place in unity in game.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.910
So I'm going to name this material.

06:35.910 --> 06:42.390
The same thing I've named my cube I'll copy this and I'll just come over and paste this right into here.

06:42.390 --> 06:42.690
All right.

06:42.690 --> 06:50.550
So now I have an object with a name and a material ready to go over to unity.

06:50.610 --> 06:55.920
There are a couple of different ways to do this but the way I like to transfer projects into unity is

06:55.920 --> 07:02.410
by using the FBI X file format and you can drag a blend file directly into unity.

07:02.490 --> 07:06.390
But all it does is open up Blendr in the background.

07:06.390 --> 07:13.000
Use Blender's FDX converter to convert the file to SBX and then enclose Blendr in the background.

07:13.200 --> 07:18.820
So if it's going to use Blender's FDX converter anyway why not go ahead and do it here.

07:19.080 --> 07:26.210
So I'm going to come up here to file and I'm going to go to export and I'm going to choose SBX.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.360
Now this particular scene has a few elements in it.

07:29.360 --> 07:35.280
It's got a camera it's got a point light it has my cube but I only want to export that cube so I'm going

07:35.280 --> 07:41.310
to choose select objects or selected objects right down here I have that cube selected.

07:41.450 --> 07:45.300
I'm going to browse to the folder that I want to export to.

07:45.300 --> 07:51.870
I think I'm to create a whole new folder here called exports and that will be kind of the transitionary

07:51.870 --> 07:57.460
place while going to put my FP x files before I take them into unity.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.260
So I'm going to go and create a new folder here.

08:00.420 --> 08:04.700
Call it exports and open that up.

08:04.740 --> 08:12.030
Now I'm going to give this a name what docs call this I called it Blendr cube denie So we've got Blendr

08:12.030 --> 08:13.520
cube SBX.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.280
I've chosen the selected objects.

08:16.280 --> 08:21.250
I'm using this FDX 7.4 binary version.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.930
And now I'll just click export FDX.

08:24.940 --> 08:26.800
All right so there it goes.

08:26.800 --> 08:32.530
Now here in unity we need to bring that object into the assets folder.

08:32.580 --> 08:38.020
When there's a couple of things I want to point out as we do now if you want to just bring one item

08:38.020 --> 08:45.430
into the assets folder here you can right click in the assets folder and go to import new asset and

08:45.430 --> 08:55.030
that will bring up a browser window that will allow you to go to your folder and find your file.

08:55.030 --> 08:59.130
Now if you look up here it says you can also import files by dragging them.

08:59.140 --> 09:06.820
So if you have multiple files multiple FBI exes or textures or whatever you should just open up your

09:06.820 --> 09:09.740
windows explorer or your Finder window whatever.

09:09.880 --> 09:15.430
Select the multiple files and drag them directly into the assets folder here.

09:15.460 --> 09:22.390
But since I only have one to bring in I'm going to just use this process select the blender cube and

09:22.390 --> 09:24.230
click Import.

09:24.530 --> 09:29.750
Now the reason why I gave that cube a material is because I wanted to show you this when ever you bring

09:29.750 --> 09:31.840
in a new object.

09:32.150 --> 09:38.480
It's going to bring in its materials and it's going to look for a folder called materials and if it

09:38.480 --> 09:43.270
can't find on it will create one and put that material in it.

09:43.730 --> 09:50.690
So what I always do is when I bring a model in when I bring in FBI X and I always bring it into the

09:50.930 --> 09:58.880
root assets folder and let it drop the material into the materials folder is just easier that way.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.920
But what I can do is make sure I keep everything neat and tidy.

10:03.020 --> 10:10.430
So I'm going to go ahead and right click choose create choose folder and I'm going to call this models

10:10.880 --> 10:15.040
and this is where I will put all the models I bring in.

10:15.260 --> 10:20.930
So once again I'm going to bring any new models into the assets folder here.

10:20.930 --> 10:26.630
It will automatically drop the material into the materials folder and then I'll just drag that object

10:26.960 --> 10:29.270
into the models folder.

10:29.270 --> 10:29.500
All right.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.580
Let's take a look at this and see how we did.

10:31.580 --> 10:37.280
I'm going to click this blender cube and drag it up here into the hierarchy and drop it.

10:37.790 --> 10:38.800
And here it is.

10:38.810 --> 10:43.540
But I don't see it because it's right inside that cube.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.390
And this is a good thing.

10:46.210 --> 10:54.320
Notice that hour one by one cube in unity is matching exactly are one by one cube and blender.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.460
That's exactly what we want.

10:57.450 --> 11:04.860
So the take away from this is to be sure and set up your unit of measure ahead of time.

11:05.010 --> 11:09.540
So you know exactly how big things should be.

11:09.540 --> 11:16.230
Now I know that one meter in Blender is going to equal one meter in unity and I'll have a good sense

11:16.320 --> 11:21.780
of how big things should be as I begin creating the objects.

11:21.790 --> 11:26.800
Now there's another thing I want to mention here in unity and that's the camera.

11:26.810 --> 11:33.300
Now what we're going to be doing is we're going to bring in our environment models here from Blender

11:33.690 --> 11:39.360
and then we're going to want to be able to run the game and move through the scene to check out how

11:39.360 --> 11:40.820
everything is looking.

11:40.870 --> 11:45.860
So what we need to do is have a camera that we can move around.

11:45.930 --> 11:52.830
Once we turn on the game if I run the game now and I click the play button right up here you can see

11:52.880 --> 11:55.950
here's our game but I can't move around.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.120
I can't look around.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.320
I can't move around with the WASC keys.

12:00.330 --> 12:01.210
I can't do anything.

12:01.210 --> 12:07.420
So let me hit the play button again to turn unity off turn the game off there.

12:07.470 --> 12:14.130
So what I want to do is create a ground plane here in unity that we can run around on as we bring in

12:14.130 --> 12:19.650
our objects so I'm going to go ahead and delete this cube and I'm going to go ahead and delete this

12:19.650 --> 12:24.450
cube as well just right click and choose delete.

12:24.780 --> 12:31.920
And I'm going to go to Blendr and use Blender to create a ground plane just for the floor.

12:31.920 --> 12:38.130
This may not be our final floor but I think it's a good thing to do once again to test our pipeline

12:38.340 --> 12:44.340
to test our process and to get used to going between these two programs so I'm going to select everything

12:44.340 --> 12:48.220
here with the key and just press X and delete.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.650
So now we just have a clean scene here.

12:50.730 --> 12:56.420
I'm going to go to the Create tab and create a polygon plane and I'm going to scale it up.

12:56.550 --> 12:58.570
So it's about as big as the grid here.

12:58.860 --> 13:06.570
And if I press the end key and go up to the top you can see that I've created a polygon plane that's

13:06.570 --> 13:09.320
about 16 meters by 16 meters.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.630
Now let's go ahead and say 20 by 20.

13:12.630 --> 13:16.380
Why not let's do that.

13:16.380 --> 13:23.680
I'm going to give this a name and come over here to the out liner and call it just call it floor.

13:23.730 --> 13:31.590
Once again this may not be the final floor but it's going to serve its purpose here here in the materials

13:31.590 --> 13:36.240
panel saw continue and with this new material I'll call this floor.

13:36.480 --> 13:43.880
I'd just like to try and keep the materials and the object names if not the same have some sort of a

13:43.890 --> 13:45.360
relationship.

13:45.360 --> 13:50.340
Also I think I'll press the tab key to go into that mode and I think I want to add some polygons to

13:50.340 --> 13:51.150
this floor.

13:51.150 --> 13:57.960
Currently it's just one big polygon so I'm going to press the W key and choose subdivide.

13:58.230 --> 14:03.750
And you can see that it's subdivided this into four polygons.

14:03.750 --> 14:10.010
I'll come over here and increase the number of cuts from one oh maybe.

14:10.070 --> 14:18.350
Let's go up to five here and with five cuts it looks like I've got 36 faces on this.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.420
That looks fine to me.

14:20.420 --> 14:20.930
Here it is.

14:20.930 --> 14:22.780
If I hit the A key.

14:22.970 --> 14:23.300
All right.

14:23.300 --> 14:28.280
So let's go ahead and take this into unity as well.

14:28.610 --> 14:40.400
So I'm going to go to a file export FBA X. I'll call this floor and notice here I've still got my selected

14:40.460 --> 14:42.740
object checked.

14:42.740 --> 14:47.640
I'm still in the exports folder here so I'll just click export SBX.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.020
All right.

14:48.020 --> 14:52.610
Let's go over to unity now here in Unity.

14:52.610 --> 14:56.930
I'll go ahead and open up a Finder window here.

14:57.880 --> 15:06.980
And in here I'll go into my exports and grabbed that floor and drag it in.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.960
Now I'm going to drag it over here into the assets folder so that when it comes in and wants to drop

15:13.960 --> 15:20.660
its material into a materials folder it'll see that materials folder there it is.

15:21.100 --> 15:26.120
And now I'll just take that model and drag it into the models folder.

15:27.070 --> 15:27.710
All right.

15:27.840 --> 15:34.090
So now I'm going to grab that floor drag it into the hierarchy it'll drop him to the scene it's at 0

15:34.090 --> 15:38.020
0 0 in the position fields here.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.050
That's good.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.420
So there is our first object now.

15:42.780 --> 15:45.470
It is currently selected to de-select it.

15:45.480 --> 15:51.400
You can click anywhere or you can just drag click and drag with the mouse as well.

15:53.490 --> 15:59.940
All right so what I want to be able to do is I want to be able to run around on this plane currently

15:59.940 --> 16:05.610
If I hit the play key you can see we can't move at all.

16:05.640 --> 16:13.080
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to import one of the pre-made packages that comes with unity that

16:13.080 --> 16:19.470
has a first person controller in it that I can use to run around and test my scene.

16:19.710 --> 16:27.840
So I come over here to the assets folder right click and go to import package and under here I'm going

16:27.840 --> 16:32.850
to bring in the characters package that comes with unity.

16:32.870 --> 16:34.120
Here it is the whole thing.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.270
I'm going to click Import

16:38.240 --> 16:39.320
and what it will do.

16:39.320 --> 16:46.490
It will create a standard assets folder and it will have the character package in that standard assets

16:46.490 --> 16:47.080
folder.

16:48.250 --> 16:48.770
All right.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.260
So here's that standard assets.

16:51.260 --> 16:58.670
Here's my characters and right in here in first person control or we've got a folder called prefabs.

16:58.780 --> 17:03.030
If I open that up you can see we've got two first person controllers.

17:03.170 --> 17:08.660
One is an FP controller and that has quite a bit of stuff on it.

17:08.660 --> 17:13.070
Components on it including an audio source here.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.370
So if we take a look at this one the rigid body.

17:17.440 --> 17:24.050
Yes this one doesn't have any audio on it and this is the one I usually use so I'm going to take this

17:24.680 --> 17:27.680
and drag it up into the hierarchy and there it is.

17:27.680 --> 17:38.030
So it's been dropped in here at 0 0 0 but it needs to be pulled up just a bit so it's just above the

17:38.030 --> 17:39.770
ground plane.

17:39.770 --> 17:48.720
Now if I hit play I can now move around but the problem is is I'm just falling now I've fallen down

17:48.720 --> 17:57.810
through the polygon planes so what I need to do is create a collider that will keep me from falling

17:57.810 --> 17:59.160
down through it.

17:59.160 --> 18:05.740
So what I can do is choose this floor object here and add a collider to it.

18:05.850 --> 18:14.520
So if I come over here to add component with the floor selected and go to physics and Bach's Collider

18:15.000 --> 18:22.580
that will add a box Collider to that object so that now when I hit play I don't fall through.

18:22.590 --> 18:31.230
So now I can move the mouse around and WASC D and move and run around this polygon plane.

18:31.290 --> 18:31.930
All right.

18:32.070 --> 18:37.460
So this is going to be our kind of our test area and hit escape.

18:37.530 --> 18:41.340
And then I can push the play button here.

18:41.430 --> 18:48.360
So that's just going to be our our test area that we can run around and take a look at our scene as

18:48.360 --> 18:49.430
we build it.

18:49.440 --> 18:54.050
Now I noticed down here it says there are two audio listeners in the scene.

18:54.080 --> 18:54.680
You.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.430
Exactly one.

18:56.490 --> 19:06.450
One thing we can do is delete this main camera because it has an audio listener on it and so does this

19:06.450 --> 19:08.580
camera as well so that's the problem.

19:08.760 --> 19:16.260
Let's go and take this main camera that came in the scene when we first opened it and delete that right

19:16.260 --> 19:17.920
click and delete.

19:17.970 --> 19:22.030
So now we only have one camera in the scene and that's that's good.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.420
And they change the name of this.

19:23.430 --> 19:28.570
I think I'll just call it player and we go.

19:28.830 --> 19:34.920
And now if we run the game again you can see that error goes away and we can run around

19:38.840 --> 19:39.750
on the floor.

19:39.770 --> 19:42.920
All right good.

19:43.190 --> 19:49.850
So now we've set up our scene in unity we can begin working in blender and bring in our assets piece

19:49.850 --> 19:50.390
by piece.
