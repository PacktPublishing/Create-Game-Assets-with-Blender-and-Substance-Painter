WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:03.920
So for our next object let's go ahead and create a coffee table.

00:03.920 --> 00:09.830
I mean we've got the sofa let's create a coffee table here now in Blender we were able to run the game

00:09.860 --> 00:12.060
and then walk around the room.

00:12.110 --> 00:18.520
We can do that here in blender as well if you press shift F and then hit the tab key.

00:18.710 --> 00:26.120
You can drop down to the ground now and I can move around with the mouse here and then press WASC D

00:26.150 --> 00:27.600
and move around.

00:27.740 --> 00:33.070
So I going to I'll try and just go in here and see how things look.

00:34.060 --> 00:36.440
Doesn't look too bad.

00:36.610 --> 00:41.980
I can move around here and to get a sense of what the room is going to feel like.

00:41.980 --> 00:45.910
So it's kind of a nice thing to be able to do here in blender as well.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.320
Yeah.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.460
So why don't we put a coffee table right in here.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.110
I'm going to hit the escape key now.

00:54.210 --> 00:57.380
And now we're back to our original view.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.770
So I'm going to create this very simple kind of coffee table here.

01:01.920 --> 01:08.690
It's got woodgrain for the legs and frame and then it's got this formica finish.

01:08.820 --> 01:16.770
And I think what I want to do is use two different materials and two different U-V maps and yet keep

01:16.770 --> 01:17.920
it all one object.

01:18.030 --> 01:19.290
So let's give that a try.

01:19.290 --> 01:26.400
I'm going to go over to a brand new layer here and let's just begin creating this coffee table.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.140
It looks like it's pretty straightforward.

01:28.140 --> 01:31.770
It's just some cubes so let's go ahead and create a cube here.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.670
I'm going to.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.630
First off.

01:33.630 --> 01:42.780
Go to face mode and select the top face and the bottom face and go ahead and delete these with X and

01:42.780 --> 01:44.450
delete faces.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.370
And now I can begin working on the legs here.

01:49.490 --> 01:57.480
I'm going to scale that down a bit and maybe make it a little bit taller with s and Z and this can be

01:57.480 --> 01:59.890
one of our legs.

02:00.110 --> 02:07.280
I'll bring it up just above the grid here because it looks like it's got little feet underneath there

02:07.280 --> 02:09.070
that's holding it up off the ground.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.560
So that can be one of our legs.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.010
Maybe I'll move this over just to get a sense of the size of it.

02:17.010 --> 02:24.180
Let's say something like that and let's work on this piece right up here on top or create another cube

02:24.190 --> 02:32.820
you can do that with shift a and then select cube from the menu here and I'll press S Z to scale it

02:32.820 --> 02:33.580
down.

02:35.070 --> 02:41.220
And let's scale it out in the y s y maybe something like this.

02:41.290 --> 02:48.960
Let's see what we have here yeah maybe a little bit longer x y something like that maybe.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.480
And I'll bring this up to about where we want it.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.760
Something like that.

02:55.020 --> 02:57.690
And I'll go ahead and shrink this leg down a bit.

02:57.690 --> 03:04.000
I just like to try and get a sense of the scale and proportion of the objects as I'm going here.

03:04.140 --> 03:09.960
So I'm just going to select these edges here and bring them down a bit like that

03:12.620 --> 03:16.460
and let's see how this looks if I slide that in here.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.060
All right.

03:20.070 --> 03:27.540
I think that's beginning to look OK I think I want to bring the scale or the diameter of the leg down

03:27.540 --> 03:27.980
a bit.

03:27.990 --> 03:34.260
So to do that I'm going to hit the ESC key and then I do not want to scale it in the z axis or press

03:34.470 --> 03:35.610
shift Z.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.600
And now I'm only scaling in the x and y.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.850
Let's bring it down about like that.

03:41.850 --> 03:48.930
Now for this top piece it looks as if we've got an angled bit right here.

03:48.930 --> 03:55.480
Now I could insert an edge loop and scale the face down on the top.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.180
Of course there's always multiple ways to do things.

03:58.180 --> 04:03.520
But let's work with a new tool here for this course.

04:03.520 --> 04:12.010
Let's go ahead and press alt and click and shift and click these edges around here.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.470
And now we can bevel this.

04:14.530 --> 04:23.200
So if I press control B and drag with the mouse you can see I can bevel this but that bevels looking

04:23.200 --> 04:24.260
awfully flat.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.210
I'm not getting it.

04:25.210 --> 04:28.480
So it's angled in like this.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.110
See how it's just staying on top.

04:32.410 --> 04:39.250
So what the problem is once again is that we don't have uniform scale for our object.

04:39.370 --> 04:45.850
If we come over here to the properties panel by pressing the in key and bring up here we can see that

04:45.850 --> 04:48.490
we do not have uniform scale.

04:48.490 --> 04:52.290
So let's just come over here and press control a.

04:52.300 --> 04:57.940
When we're in Object mode and go ahead and apply the scale.

04:57.940 --> 05:05.230
Now if we tab back into edit mode with these edges still selected I'll press control B and pull out

05:05.230 --> 05:11.740
with the mouse and you can see now we're getting more of the effect that we want and I'm going to press

05:11.740 --> 05:15.960
the shift key as I drag just to make the move and a little bit slower.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.910
So something like that.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.830
So once again having uniform scale is an important thing for many of the tools that you're going to

05:25.830 --> 05:28.520
be using and Blendr.

05:28.540 --> 05:33.050
So we've got that now we need a little piece on the top.

05:33.050 --> 05:39.260
There's just this little extra piece right up here that's that for Mike a bit that we're going to have

05:39.260 --> 05:41.270
a new material for.

05:41.300 --> 05:51.680
So I'll just select this one face of duplicate it with shift d hit enter and Nauman to drag up just

05:51.680 --> 06:00.570
a little bit and where it is going to scale it in just a hair and we go.

06:00.910 --> 06:10.270
And then I can press e to extrude and extrude on down now look at what happened again here remember

06:10.270 --> 06:15.850
with the arm of the couch we had the problem with our normal's they were flipped.

06:16.030 --> 06:19.020
Well we're having the same issue here as well.

06:19.180 --> 06:24.660
I mean just scale this in a bit in the X. It looks like I could scaled in just a bit here.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.020
Yeah I like that.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.780
So we've got this problem with this part of the table.

06:30.790 --> 06:38.350
I'm going to hover over a face and press the L key to slide the whole thing the whole piece even though

06:38.350 --> 06:44.800
that's part of the rest of the object of the top of the table here pressing the L key only selects the

06:44.800 --> 06:46.390
linked components.

06:46.390 --> 06:48.860
So I can then press control in.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.170
And now all of the normals are facing the proper direction they're facing out.

06:56.170 --> 07:03.840
Now I don't need that face underneath here so I could probably press shift h to isolate it.

07:04.060 --> 07:13.530
Select that one face x and delete faces and now press alt h to bring everything else back.

07:13.570 --> 07:13.840
All right.

07:13.840 --> 07:20.820
So now we've got the table top with that little formica top thing there.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.720
We also need this piece right here.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.850
Let's take a look at creating that.

07:27.110 --> 07:36.320
Once again I'll just come over to the Create tab impress cube and let's scale it down with the key scale

07:36.400 --> 07:42.150
and the x with x and x and let's move it up into place.

07:43.030 --> 07:49.720
I think I'll hit the one key no let's go with the three key here and the five key just so I can come

07:49.720 --> 07:58.670
into orthographic view and take a look at this all kind of arrange these properly something like that

08:00.370 --> 08:03.710
this piece looks like maybe it could be a little bit smaller.

08:05.920 --> 08:13.130
And then I'll scale in the y s y scale that out there we go.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.650
I can take this piece now and duplicate it.

08:17.870 --> 08:21.780
Shift d the y key and drag it over here.

08:23.310 --> 08:24.380
Here we go.

08:24.900 --> 08:32.590
Now select this piece here and move it forward in line with the legs of the table.

08:32.750 --> 08:38.110
Hit the three key note the one key and move this over.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.850
Hit the Zeek here to go to wireframe and let's just put it right about there.

08:43.850 --> 08:47.920
All right so now we can select these three pieces.

08:48.280 --> 08:58.990
Go to our top view with the seven key and shift D and hit the x key and move these over something like

08:58.990 --> 08:59.560
that.

09:01.590 --> 09:05.380
And I'll just take this one and move it over just a little bit like that.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.330
There we go.

09:07.280 --> 09:15.130
Now we should create the pieces on the ends so I'll duplicate this and hit enter drag it into the center

09:15.130 --> 09:27.660
a bit and then I'll rotate it with our z 9:0 and move this up and scale it in and the x x x and then

09:27.660 --> 09:33.720
we just need to put it down here shifty and the Y key and move it down here.

09:33.960 --> 09:41.030
I think I'd like little feet on the bottom here so maybe I'll create a cylinder.

09:41.190 --> 09:47.640
We don't need 32 sides to it maybe I'll just take it down to oh I don't know eight and we don't need

09:47.940 --> 09:53.210
the Caps filled so I'll change that to nothing and now scale this down.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.070
Pretty small here.

09:57.690 --> 10:00.630
And let's take a look.

10:01.520 --> 10:08.340
You know we go hit the one key on the numpad to go to the front view.

10:09.670 --> 10:13.890
And I'll bring this up just a smidge to there.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.860
And I just want this underneath here just in case it's ever seen.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.170
It's probably not going to be seen really.

10:23.230 --> 10:27.110
I'll press shift D and X and drag it over to the other side.

10:28.490 --> 10:36.160
Go to the top view with the seven key and let's put these in place right down here.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.300
Shifty why and put these in place right over here.

10:41.370 --> 10:42.970
OK.

10:43.010 --> 10:47.080
All right so now that we have our coffee table let's go ahead and quickly U-V map it.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.940
So I'll come back over here to the U-V editing screen layout.

10:52.130 --> 10:56.060
I'll select everything and frame it up with the period key.

10:56.060 --> 11:00.970
So let's begin now that everything's selected Let's begin by just joining everything into one object

11:00.980 --> 11:05.580
because we want this piece to be all one object home and press control J.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.510
And now everything is on one object.

11:08.510 --> 11:14.290
I want the pivot point of this object to be in the center here right on the floor of the grid.

11:14.360 --> 11:19.190
And this is one of the reasons why I tend to model things right in the center of the grid.

11:19.190 --> 11:27.290
It's really easy to do things like mirroring to snap the pivot point to the 3D cursor in the center

11:27.290 --> 11:32.550
of the grid so everything is centered and the pivot point is where it needs to be going to hit the T

11:32.570 --> 11:35.450
key and open up the Tools panel here.

11:35.470 --> 11:43.550
And I just want to go up to the Tools tab and choose set origin to 3D cursor so that makes sure that

11:43.790 --> 11:50.080
the pivot point of this object is on the floor in the center so it's easy to move around a tab into

11:50.100 --> 11:54.450
edit mode and let's begin U-V mapping this object.

11:54.710 --> 12:05.030
We could probably just select the inside edges of these legs here and add seams to these here control

12:05.030 --> 12:06.980
the mark seam.

12:07.280 --> 12:15.650
We could probably do the same for our little tiny feet down here just select an interior edge of each

12:15.650 --> 12:16.320
of these.

12:16.340 --> 12:25.700
And Marcus seem like that and these pieces here these crossbars we don't really need the end pieces

12:25.730 --> 12:27.320
for these parts.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.160
Now do we.

12:28.160 --> 12:34.850
So if I hit the Z key to go to wireframe and then I'm going to control tab and hit the three key to

12:34.850 --> 12:36.380
go to face mode.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.850
These faces right in here.

12:38.960 --> 12:45.830
They're not going to be seen so I'm just going to select those and hit X and delete faces because frankly

12:45.860 --> 12:49.080
I don't want to be mad at them if they're not going to be seen.

12:49.100 --> 12:49.930
Get rid of those.

12:49.930 --> 12:59.040
That makes my life a lot easier because now I can just come in here and select these edges.

13:00.350 --> 13:08.280
On the inside bottom and just mark a seam and there we go and we're done with those.

13:08.330 --> 13:17.660
Now for this top piece we could probably try all clicking this edge say and each one of these alt shift

13:17.660 --> 13:24.160
click the is and probably Mark seems right along here.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.930
Let's try that.

13:27.140 --> 13:35.870
And I think maybe I'll mark ISim all the way around here as well just to split out that bottom piece

13:37.460 --> 13:39.550
I think I'll split out that top piece too.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.390
Why not.

13:40.760 --> 13:47.320
I'm going to go ahead and mark a scene here and then split these out as well.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.790
And we go that makes my life a little easier.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.500
And that top piece let me just see how that works.

13:59.730 --> 14:05.520
Since we don't have a bottom to it it may just open up just fine in the mapping.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.780
We'll see.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.590
So I'll hit the A key.

14:09.290 --> 14:10.670
To select everything.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.380
I'll press you.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.410
Now wait a minute.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.550
I didn't check the scale so let's do that.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.290
I'll hit escape.

14:18.290 --> 14:26.240
Hit the in key and tab back into object mode and sure enough let me apply the transforms for the scale

14:26.240 --> 14:29.800
here control a scale.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.560
All right.

14:30.590 --> 14:36.880
Now let's go back in to edit mode select everything hit the key and unwrap.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.640
All right that's not looking too bad.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.810
I'll switch from conformable to angle based and see what I get.

14:43.130 --> 14:45.640
Yeah I can let conformal a little better.

14:45.920 --> 14:52.460
Well that's not too bad but I'd kind of like all of these pieces going in the same direction because

14:52.460 --> 14:58.490
it's going to be easier for me to lay down woodgrain and have it all go in a certain direction.

14:58.550 --> 15:01.790
If all of these are aligned the same.

15:01.790 --> 15:09.050
So to maximize this screen here all hover over it and press control up arrow and then.

15:09.050 --> 15:12.090
Now I can work with just the U-V map here.

15:12.990 --> 15:20.460
So I think what I want to do is take everything and make it go in the same direction.

15:20.460 --> 15:23.710
So maybe I want it all to be up and down.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.930
So I'll take something like this and press our 9:0.

15:28.410 --> 15:36.600
And now we can begin arranging the is so something like this are 9:0 And that's kind of why I broke

15:36.600 --> 15:46.950
the top of the coffee table apart from the beveled sides so I could turn these in the same direction

15:46.950 --> 15:48.200
as everything else.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.690
And for this it looks like here is that top part.

15:53.750 --> 15:59.900
This I think is going to be its own U-V maps so I'm going to move this aside and these pieces here are

15:59.900 --> 16:03.790
the underside and the top of the coffee table.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.650
But they're really not going to be seen very much at all.

16:06.670 --> 16:14.060
So I'm going to shrink these down quite a bit and rotate them 90 degrees and I'll put them with all

16:14.060 --> 16:15.610
of these.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.050
Select the key and click and drag.

16:20.260 --> 16:24.330
To select all of these.

16:24.530 --> 16:26.170
And let's see how this works.

16:26.180 --> 16:34.430
I'm going to scale these up some and try and maximize the resolution within this zero to one the space.

16:34.430 --> 16:37.640
Let me try and put these in place in here.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.300
There we go.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.160
All right.

16:41.190 --> 16:45.500
Oh and I want to put these guys right in here.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.040
On this map as well I put them over here.

16:50.060 --> 16:51.860
Why not.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.040
Here we go.

16:53.540 --> 16:58.430
I'll press control up arrow to go back to my normal view.

16:58.430 --> 17:02.490
So there is the U-V map of the woodgrain part.

17:02.600 --> 17:08.420
So I will go ahead and create the material for the woodgrain or go to object mode.

17:08.720 --> 17:22.400
New material called this coffee table would and now tab into edit mode and just select this top piece

17:22.410 --> 17:31.770
this formica piece I'll hit the L key on one of the edges right there and I will create a new material

17:31.770 --> 17:42.320
slot A new material and I'll call this coffee table top mainly because I don't know how to spell formica

17:43.680 --> 17:51.570
so now I want to assign these faces to that coffee table top material.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.920
So with that slight it all just click a sign.

17:55.950 --> 18:01.860
And now if I click de-select it will de-select that I click select it will select that and then if I

18:01.950 --> 18:05.730
select the word in hit select it will select that.

18:05.730 --> 18:15.570
So notice when I select everything in the table would material we see only the U-V map for that part.

18:15.840 --> 18:24.630
And if I de-select that and like the coffee table and hit select We only see the U.V. map of this.

18:24.750 --> 18:30.490
Now I can take this and move it over and scale it up.

18:31.110 --> 18:35.420
So it fits in the whole U-V map there.

18:35.460 --> 18:42.570
Now when we take these in the unity it will see these as two separate materials with two separate U-V

18:42.570 --> 18:43.320
maps.

18:43.320 --> 18:51.900
So in the next video what let's do is go ahead and export the U.V. map out to photoshop texture it and

18:51.900 --> 18:54.150
then take it into unity and test this.
