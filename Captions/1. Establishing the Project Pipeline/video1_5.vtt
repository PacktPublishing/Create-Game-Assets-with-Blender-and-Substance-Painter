WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:02.220
So it's bringing everything back.

00:02.330 --> 00:03.670
H.

00:03.910 --> 00:07.050
Now what have we done this yet.

00:07.180 --> 00:11.760
Did we do this didn't look like we have OK.

00:12.820 --> 00:19.450
Let's go ahead and take the views down to one let's apply it and let's take a look at what we want to

00:19.450 --> 00:20.290
take away here.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.110
I think we could take away most of this

00:25.910 --> 00:32.060
right in here with the C key acts and faces.

00:32.150 --> 00:36.630
I think what we should also do is take away down here at the bottom this is going to be against a wall.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.080
I don't think we can.

00:38.080 --> 00:42.760
We're going to see anything down here we may not even see anything in the back but I'm going to leave

00:42.760 --> 00:47.950
that just in case we want to put it up against or pull it out from the wall at all.

00:49.570 --> 00:52.390
So delete those faces.

00:55.460 --> 01:07.250
Now for our seam we could probably create a seam or maybe just break this out here.

01:07.660 --> 01:11.630
Yeah let's do that let's break this out right here and here.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.510
And that will I think that will be fine.

01:17.510 --> 01:22.300
Let's control ie and mark a scene there and let's try it.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.550
I'll hit a.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.580
Did I apply the transformations.

01:27.590 --> 01:29.410
I don't think I did.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.100
I did not see there.

01:31.100 --> 01:31.550
All right.

01:31.580 --> 01:47.960
So control a rotation in scale hit you and unwrap Let's try angle based conformal doesn't really matter.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.050
OK I'll go with angle based.

01:50.120 --> 01:55.760
Now what I want to do ultimately I will do the little feet down here.

01:55.760 --> 02:03.620
But what I want to do first is delete these pieces right here because I haven't U-V mapped any of these

02:03.620 --> 02:09.400
write X and delete and I haven't be mapped this at all either so X and delete that.

02:09.590 --> 02:13.070
So now I just have the things that I've actually U-V mapped.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.970
These are the ones I want to keep.

02:15.020 --> 02:21.170
Now I want to duplicate these over and fill up the couch with them so I like this.

02:21.170 --> 02:29.390
And this may go to my top view and my orthographic view with the five key press shift D and Y and move

02:29.390 --> 02:30.880
these over a bit.

02:31.190 --> 02:40.700
If you'll just select this and move it over and even these out a bit like that and then I'll press shift

02:40.820 --> 02:43.660
D and Y and move these over.

02:43.970 --> 02:44.900
OK.

02:44.900 --> 02:53.330
Now this one this one if I just press shift D and Y and and move this over here you can see that the

02:53.330 --> 02:57.320
problem is is you've got that and that's ugly.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.030
So you don't want that.

02:59.030 --> 03:04.660
So what I can do is I can actually flip this I can actually mirror this in the y axis.

03:04.790 --> 03:11.420
I mean the five key to go back to perspective view to do then I can come down here to the object menu

03:11.700 --> 03:20.310
go to mirror and then choose Y global and then hit enter and then we go.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.230
Now it's been flipped over.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.600
All right.

03:24.600 --> 03:31.500
So there we've got our couch with all the pillows U-V mapped which is kind of nice.

03:31.920 --> 03:40.800
What we want to do now is join all these objects together and put them all in the same U-V map so that

03:40.800 --> 03:45.820
we can put all one material like this glorious floral pattern over here.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.420
So if I just select everything shifts like everything here

03:54.160 --> 03:59.280
now I can join them all together by pressing control J.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.960
And that'll bring them all together.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.530
And look what happened over here.

04:03.700 --> 04:10.950
Makow this one object because that happened kind of flipped it kind of changed colors.

04:10.990 --> 04:16.210
The reason why that happened is because it was mirrored in when it was mirrored and then we applied

04:16.210 --> 04:17.940
the transforms on it.

04:18.070 --> 04:24.970
The normal's or the faces are pointing in now instead of pointing out in other words we're seeing the

04:24.970 --> 04:31.300
back side of the polygons and we don't want that because when we take this into unity or any game engine

04:31.390 --> 04:36.040
you can't see the back of a poly on in other words you'll see right through it.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.210
It'll be transparent.

04:37.360 --> 04:43.350
So this arm of the couch will be transparent and we don't want that to happen.

04:43.390 --> 04:47.180
So what we can do is tab into edit mode.

04:47.200 --> 04:55.990
You can hover over this and press the key to select all linked faces and we can delimit that by seam

04:56.020 --> 05:03.190
or the normal's or biomaterials So if I press material then it'll like the whole thing because it's

05:03.190 --> 05:08.410
a continuous single material over that whole piece of the object.

05:08.410 --> 05:16.140
Now I can press control n and that will flip the normal's or the faces back out again.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.720
So now everything's facing out.

05:19.770 --> 05:28.960
OK so now let's go back to that U-V editing view and if we tab into edit mode and we hit the A key I'm

05:28.960 --> 05:31.580
going to hit this button right down here again.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.530
We hit the A key we can see that it is a total mess.

05:35.740 --> 05:41.270
All the movies are overlapping each other and it's just that's not going to work.

05:41.410 --> 05:44.440
I'm going to press the control up arrow here.

05:44.440 --> 05:52.600
So what we need to do is spread all these Uvas out and arrange them so they aren't overlapping like

05:52.600 --> 05:57.000
I could take this and G and move it over here.

05:57.010 --> 06:00.850
And then I could see and move this over here and that would take a while.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.350
So we don't want to do that.

06:02.370 --> 06:04.950
I can hit the A key to select everything.

06:05.230 --> 06:08.520
And what I'll do is use this Uvas menu.

06:08.560 --> 06:15.850
And over here we have average Island scale and we have pack islands average and scale we'll take every

06:15.850 --> 06:23.050
island in here that is selected I should say and make them the same scale in proportion as on the actual

06:23.050 --> 06:24.130
3D object.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.710
So I'll press control.

06:26.370 --> 06:30.710
So that made the big things big and the small things small.

06:31.150 --> 06:38.710
And now the trick is to take all these islands with their proportional size intact and fit them into

06:38.710 --> 06:46.090
this zero to one space here right into there into into that gray Square.

06:46.090 --> 06:55.410
To do that we can use the pack Islands which is control P and then we go Navman pest control up arrow.

06:55.600 --> 07:02.090
We can always rotate them here like this kind of like that actually.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.450
Yeah I kind of like that.

07:04.450 --> 07:07.520
So there we have our U-V mapped couch.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.210
Now for the legs.

07:10.270 --> 07:16.710
I'm going to have them be a separate object because they're going to need to be a separate material.

07:16.720 --> 07:23.170
This is going to be all one material but the legs here are going to be wood or metal or something other

07:23.170 --> 07:24.600
than fabric.

07:24.610 --> 07:33.080
So to do that I'm going to come in here and select all of them and join them together with control.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.190
Jay I'll tab into edit mode.

07:36.220 --> 07:41.560
Good edge mode and I'm just going to select an edge on each one of these kind of on the inside

07:46.120 --> 07:48.940
kind of like this and like this.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.650
I'm just pressing shift here.

07:51.910 --> 07:55.770
Control the mark seam.

07:55.810 --> 08:04.660
Now if I select everything with the key go back to my U-V editing view and press you and unwrap that

08:04.750 --> 08:08.890
unwraps all of them except it didn't work on two of them now did it.

08:08.890 --> 08:15.910
Which ones did it work on it looks like it worked on these but somehow I lost my seams over here.

08:15.940 --> 08:28.690
So I'll have to just add them back like that work seem now select everything you do and wrap.

08:28.690 --> 08:29.400
All right.

08:29.530 --> 08:33.590
So there is the feet.

08:33.880 --> 08:42.910
Now the last thing let's do real quick before we finish up is let's give these a name and the material

08:42.920 --> 08:50.570
we're going to need a name and a Tiriel on each of these so I'm going to select the couch part and I

08:50.590 --> 08:55.830
see a pier that is currently called cube 0 0 3 and it changed this to come.

08:56.390 --> 09:06.730
I'll call this couch fabric actually and see that here I'll also select the legs and I'll call this

09:06.730 --> 09:12.280
couch would have that be a wood material.

09:12.310 --> 09:18.670
Now over here in the materials panel click right here to bring up the materials panel and click new

09:19.450 --> 09:28.150
and for this for couch for the wood feet I'll just paste that name of the object into the name of the

09:28.150 --> 09:29.200
material.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.560
Same thing over here.

09:30.580 --> 09:37.430
I'll just paste the couch fabric name into the material field here.

09:37.810 --> 09:46.000
So we have our object names the same as our material names and that will help us keep things organized

09:46.030 --> 09:48.480
as we take things into unity.

09:48.520 --> 09:53.740
So when the next video let's go ahead and do that let's do a test run of taking it into unity and then

09:53.740 --> 09:56.030
we can begin working on texturing it.
