WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:08.100
Now let's take a look at the process for texturing an object by exploiting the U.V. map to paint program

00:08.100 --> 00:16.170
like Photoshop or Gamp or Krita and how we might use that to then lay down the texture and layer multiple

00:16.170 --> 00:18.750
textures over the U.V. map.

00:18.780 --> 00:26.730
So I'm going to tab into edit mode here for the couch and keep in mind that this is only for the fabric

00:26.730 --> 00:28.800
part of the couch not the wood part.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.730
I've separated that out into its own object.

00:32.930 --> 00:38.750
So I've tabbed into Edit Mode hit a to select everything and I get to come over here and hit a and so

00:38.750 --> 00:46.000
like everything in the U-V map is well and I'm going to go to use these and export lay out.

00:46.050 --> 00:54.000
Now when you're exporting the U.V. map out of Blendr you need to make a decision as to what size this

00:54.000 --> 00:55.980
U-V map is going to be.

00:55.980 --> 01:03.330
And for my particular purposes I'm going to make this map to K or 2048 by 2048.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.890
It's currently set to 1 K but I feel like there are times when this particular object may pretty much

01:10.890 --> 01:16.830
fill up the screen if the camera is very close to the object so I'm going to go ahead and call this

01:16.850 --> 01:20.510
to say 20 eight.

01:20.520 --> 01:29.670
Now if this happens to be too big and it's slowing down my scene slowing down my game then I can always

01:29.670 --> 01:38.400
go back into Photoshop and save out a smaller version and I'm going to come over to my textures folder

01:38.400 --> 01:41.340
here and I'm going to save it in my textures folder.

01:41.340 --> 01:47.640
But what I'm going to do is create a folder here and on the call it couch and within this folder I'm

01:47.640 --> 01:53.780
going to have all of my own files that I'm going to be using to texture this object.

01:53.790 --> 02:01.000
I'm going to have the U-V map I'm going to have the photoshop file color map maybe normal map.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.470
So all of that is going to be here in one folder.

02:04.560 --> 02:11.420
So I'll call this couch underscore Uvas an export.

02:11.430 --> 02:21.450
Now let's go to photoshop here in Photoshop I'm in a press control or command o to open and I will browse

02:21.450 --> 02:32.650
to that textures folder and my couch folder here and here are my couch UVA's so all like open.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.750
And there they are.

02:34.080 --> 02:40.710
So I don't know if it's hard to see here but if I zoom in really far you can see that there is the movies

02:41.040 --> 02:48.230
from Blender now all press control or command zero to go to full screen there.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.650
And I'm to change this flayer to call it Uvas.

02:52.230 --> 02:59.820
So I know what it is and I'll go ahead and open up that fabric seamless texture as well so control or

02:59.880 --> 03:00.490
command.

03:00.510 --> 03:08.040
Oh and let's go find our texture in our textures folder.

03:08.040 --> 03:08.880
Here it is.

03:10.740 --> 03:11.160
All right.

03:11.160 --> 03:19.070
So now that we have this I'm going to press control or command a and then Control C to copy.

03:19.290 --> 03:27.930
And now going to come over to my couch file and press control or command V to paste.

03:27.940 --> 03:35.510
Now take this layer now and drag it below the U.V. so I can see the U-V map over the texture.

03:35.550 --> 03:44.710
I pressed the key to go to the moved tool and I'll press shift and click and drag and reduce the size

03:44.710 --> 03:46.480
of this somewhat.

03:46.510 --> 03:49.240
So these are the pillows here.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.820
These are the back of the couch.

03:52.840 --> 03:59.770
So what I want to do is try and guess as best as I can how big this should be.

03:59.860 --> 04:06.030
Somebody zoom in here and just see if I can get it to be about the size that I want.

04:06.040 --> 04:13.140
So if this is the back cushion may be the size of the pattern should be about like that.

04:13.510 --> 04:15.110
Let's give that a try.

04:15.400 --> 04:24.250
So I'm going to move this up here and hit enter and now I'm going to press alt and shift and click and

04:24.250 --> 04:30.030
drag that out and put it right up next to the first one now.

04:30.250 --> 04:38.350
I need to turn on snapping so I'm going to go up to the view menu and turn on snap its shift control

04:38.350 --> 04:40.160
command semi-colon.

04:40.330 --> 04:41.650
So I'll turn that on.

04:41.650 --> 04:48.820
So now as I move this it will snap on to the first tile Now I'm going to press the arrow key one time

04:48.820 --> 04:50.790
and move it over just a little bit.

04:50.790 --> 04:57.450
So it ensures that it's sealed up or that there isn't a space between the two tiles.

04:57.550 --> 05:04.750
And I'm going to just press alt shift again and that will duplicate the tile and I'll snap it on and

05:04.750 --> 05:13.510
then move it over one with the left arrow key and I'll do that again kind of all the way over here and

05:13.630 --> 05:21.910
zoom out just a bit with control minus and I'll press the spacebar to use the hand tool to move over

05:21.910 --> 05:23.250
here.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.910
All right so shift Allt again.

05:27.370 --> 05:35.820
Snap move over one with the left arrow key and I'm just going to do this a bit and kind of tile this

05:35.820 --> 05:38.040
all the way over.

05:38.340 --> 05:42.740
Now I can do this the whole way over and that might be the way to go.

05:42.780 --> 05:48.900
Let me go ahead and do that when I can do is select a couple of these so I'll shift select a couple

05:48.900 --> 05:57.780
of the layers here like this and then press alt shift and click and drag and duplicate these over and

05:57.780 --> 06:00.790
move it over one to the left.

06:00.950 --> 06:08.510
And now maybe I'll select all these two here alt shift and duplicate these over.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.120
And there we go.

06:10.130 --> 06:13.590
Now I can select all of these layers here.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.820
And do the same thing going down.

06:18.820 --> 06:26.650
So I'll always shift this and move it down snap it move it up with the up arrow just so we seal it off

06:26.650 --> 06:29.010
a bit and keep on going

06:32.110 --> 06:34.200
and I'll do one more up here at the top.

06:34.200 --> 06:41.560
It looks like I need another one to appear so alt shift and I'll bring this all the way up snap it there

06:41.570 --> 06:47.650
move it down with it with the down key and I'll do one more like that.

06:47.780 --> 06:52.670
Now I'm going to come over here to the layers of window and I'm going to select all of these just like

06:52.670 --> 07:00.170
the top one scroll down shift select that bottom one and then press control or command E and that will

07:00.440 --> 07:03.880
merge everything down into one layer.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.280
All right so I'm going to call this fabric.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.440
So let's test this.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.150
How do we do on this.

07:11.150 --> 07:19.100
I'm going to turn off the U-V layer and I'm going to press shift alt control or command W and that will

07:19.130 --> 07:22.750
open up the export as window here.

07:22.760 --> 07:28.170
Now you can also go up to file export Export as right here.

07:31.890 --> 07:37.120
And now let's just export this out I've got it set as a P N G.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.560
It's 2048 by 2048.

07:39.570 --> 07:40.550
That's good.

07:40.590 --> 07:48.480
I'm just going to click export and I will take it over to that couch folder and I'll change it from

07:48.480 --> 07:54.980
couch to couch underscore see for color map I'll hit export.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.410
And there we go.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.270
So now if I go back to Blendr Let's take a look at it here.

08:00.300 --> 08:07.560
I'm going to switch this texture here with the one we just created so I'll hit the X to delete that

08:07.620 --> 08:10.860
or remove it out of the texture node.

08:10.870 --> 08:18.060
Now click open and I'll come over to my textures folder couch folder and there is my color channel or

08:18.060 --> 08:22.890
my color map click open and there we go.

08:23.310 --> 08:30.870
So now it looks like we've created our texture pattern way too small but we haven't in that over here

08:30.900 --> 08:34.980
under this scale fields in our texture panel.

08:35.010 --> 08:40.520
We still have 12 here so let's take this down to one and see how we did.

08:40.810 --> 08:42.950
Yeah that's pretty good.

08:42.960 --> 08:49.080
So that was a little more work than we did before but now we have more control over it.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.250
So let's say we wanted to put some dirt in stains on this.

08:52.290 --> 08:57.410
We go back to a photo shop here let me open up some grunge maps.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.350
I love grunge maps.

09:00.930 --> 09:02.750
It's just textures of dirt.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.320
So here's one.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.430
I have a grunge map from textures dot com.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.060
Here's another one here's another one.

09:11.160 --> 09:15.630
So it's just maps of dirt and just nastiness.

09:15.630 --> 09:16.890
I like it.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.950
It gives things a nice lived in feel.

09:21.150 --> 09:28.530
So I'm going to go I think with this grungy map so I'm going to select this one and open this in Photoshop

09:29.000 --> 09:35.730
and I'm going to press control or command a and then a controller command C to copy this then I'm going

09:35.730 --> 09:38.870
to come over here and paste it in here.

09:39.390 --> 09:47.460
So I'm going to press control or command V to paste that they're now going to turn on my you U-V map

09:47.460 --> 09:51.640
so we can see them overlaid over the textures.

09:51.960 --> 09:59.580
And now I'm just going to maybe take this I'm going to try and just take this over the whole thing like

09:59.640 --> 10:00.500
this.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.420
Let's see how this works.

10:02.490 --> 10:11.900
I'll change this from the normal blending mode to multiply and that gives it kind of a nasty feel to

10:11.900 --> 10:12.580
it.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.570
Let me turn off to the movies and see how it looks.

10:14.600 --> 10:14.930
Oh yeah.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.470
That looks just awful.

10:16.520 --> 10:22.870
So let's try this press shift alt command W again.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.330
To export and export all.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.430
And over.

10:28.440 --> 10:28.890
Right.

10:28.890 --> 10:37.600
That couch color map and replace and go back to Blendr and see how we did here.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.410
I'm going to remove that hit.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.400
Open.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.820
Go to that couch folder and let's choose that couch color map again.

10:45.790 --> 10:46.960
Oh my.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.180
And it's just nasty.

10:50.470 --> 10:55.600
So you can see now we have more control over our textures.

10:55.810 --> 11:03.340
I wasn't able to overlay that dirt layer by just importing the seamless map directly into a blender

11:03.580 --> 11:13.060
or unity but with this now I can make adjustments I can adjust the opacity of this let's say See I can

11:13.060 --> 11:14.840
take the opacity down a bit.

11:14.860 --> 11:17.320
Maybe that's a little too grungy.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.230
Right.

11:18.370 --> 11:25.150
And I can add more layers more grunge or dirt or textures on this however much I want.

11:25.720 --> 11:33.670
But let me just show you how I would clean this U-V map up clean this color map up before I took it

11:33.670 --> 11:39.100
into unity or before I submitted it to a production pipeline.

11:39.100 --> 11:48.550
If I were working for a studio or was working with a team of developers so what I do is I'd one make

11:48.550 --> 11:52.870
sure that all of these layers have been condensed down to one.

11:52.870 --> 12:00.600
So I'm going to select all of these and press control or command e this other layer or call this dirt.

12:00.790 --> 12:08.320
And now if I turn the movies back on what I can do is select the area outside of the movies and delete

12:08.320 --> 12:09.050
it.

12:09.070 --> 12:12.020
So let me zoom in just a bit here.

12:12.100 --> 12:17.780
I'm going to come over to the magic wand tool here in Photoshop.

12:18.160 --> 12:25.780
Select the U.V. is Lehre and then click anywhere outside the movies and that will select everything

12:25.840 --> 12:28.530
all around the U-V islands.

12:28.540 --> 12:33.950
Now it looks like it didn't get these over here so I'll press shift and click over here as well.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.560
That's like that all of those.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.270
Maybe.

12:36.370 --> 12:40.260
Shift click here and here and here over here.

12:40.360 --> 12:45.790
So I'm just trying to get all of these areas selected.

12:45.800 --> 12:54.280
There we go now I'm going to delete these areas for both of these layers but I want to make sure I don't

12:54.280 --> 13:02.080
infringe on the U-V islands themselves so here's one right here so I'm going to come up to select and

13:02.170 --> 13:09.750
I'm going to choose modify and I'm going to contract maybe by two pixels.

13:09.840 --> 13:16.290
There you go and that contracts the selection a little bit to get the selection away from the edges

13:16.290 --> 13:18.080
of the U-V islands.

13:18.090 --> 13:28.710
Now I'm going to select the dirt layer and press delete now and select the fabric layer and press delete.

13:28.890 --> 13:34.030
And now press control or command d to de-select everything.

13:34.260 --> 13:41.280
Then I'm going to create a new layer right down here at the bottom and I'll select this and make it

13:41.580 --> 13:47.510
black and then I'll use that paint bucket tool and click out here.

13:47.520 --> 13:55.320
So now if I turn off the U-V wires you can see I have a nice U-V map cleaned up a bit and ready for

13:55.320 --> 13:56.230
export.

13:56.370 --> 14:07.710
So I'll press shift alt commander control w and I'll export this out to my couch folder like that and

14:07.980 --> 14:12.800
over write that and replace it good.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.950
Now I want to save this photoshop file as well.

14:15.950 --> 14:23.080
Press control or command s and I'll save this as a SD a photoshop file.

14:23.270 --> 14:27.480
Take the Uvas off of the name and call it just couch PTSD.

14:27.500 --> 14:34.890
So now I have the photoshop file the U-V Islands and the color map all in one folder there.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.790
And click save.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.110
All right.

14:39.110 --> 14:49.450
So now if I come back over to unity and go to my couch fabric material here I can remove this texture

14:49.480 --> 14:54.800
out of the Al bedo I'll just click that little dot and then choose none.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.960
Now that's been removed.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.850
Now bring that new texture in.

14:59.890 --> 15:02.470
Bring at my Finder window.

15:02.470 --> 15:03.600
Here it is.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.660
Couch underscore.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.110
See.

15:05.110 --> 15:06.760
I'll drag that in.

15:06.910 --> 15:11.450
And now I can take that texture drag it into the Al-Bayda.

15:11.920 --> 15:19.340
And once again we still have 12 here in the tiling so I'll take that back down to one.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.430
And there we go.

15:21.430 --> 15:26.080
I can adjust that material a bit so it isn't quite so shiny.

15:26.080 --> 15:33.040
I can use the metallic and the smoothness here to reduce the shyness of it so it looks a little bit

15:33.040 --> 15:34.830
more like a fabric.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.300
And there we go.

15:36.490 --> 15:39.430
Our disgusting couch has been textured.
