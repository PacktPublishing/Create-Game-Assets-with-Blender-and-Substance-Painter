WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:07.550
We'll now that we've modeled and U-V mapped our object let's test it and take it into unity.

00:07.620 --> 00:14.320
Now as we saw before we can import this as an FBI X-File directly into unity.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.210
So what am I to do with the Lehre selected here.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.100
I'm going to go ahead and just hit the A key and select everything.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.260
Now remember we've got two objects.

00:22.260 --> 00:25.320
We've got the legs and the couch.

00:25.380 --> 00:25.890
Right.

00:26.130 --> 00:34.410
But if we select everything with the key and come over here to file and export what we can do is export

00:34.740 --> 00:39.350
the selected objects only now so we know there were other objects in the scene.

00:39.570 --> 00:45.090
But the thing I like about this particular process is you can select exactly which objects you want

00:45.090 --> 00:46.300
to transfer over.

00:46.320 --> 00:53.970
So if you've created the entire scene the entire environment in blender and you only want to take one

00:53.970 --> 01:00.540
particular updated model back into unity this is the way to do it and this is really the way I prefer

01:00.540 --> 01:01.180
to do it.

01:01.290 --> 01:04.510
Kind of one object at a time and then place them in unity.

01:04.650 --> 01:13.080
So I'm going to choose selected objects and I will come up here to my exports folder and I'll just go

01:13.080 --> 01:16.980
ahead and call this couch.

01:16.980 --> 01:21.750
So now I'm putting it in an export folder outside of unity.

01:21.810 --> 01:30.810
Currently I could go ahead and browse directly to the Unity project in the assets folder here and put

01:30.810 --> 01:34.040
it right into the models folder of unity.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.090
Well let's go ahead and do that as well.

01:36.090 --> 01:41.370
I'm going to go ahead and leave it as couch and just click export SBX.

01:41.370 --> 01:44.150
So it's really up to you how you want to do it.

01:44.160 --> 01:53.880
And every studio or company has their own ways of organizing their files managing their updates things

01:53.880 --> 01:54.870
like that.

01:54.870 --> 02:01.710
So if you're just working alone it may be tempting just to get all kind of unorganized and throw things

02:01.710 --> 02:05.270
wherever you want and and not name things well.

02:05.280 --> 02:13.020
But I really strongly suggest even if you're just working on your own to really establish an organizing

02:13.020 --> 02:16.670
scheme right up front it's going to help you.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.890
All right let's go over to unity and see what we have here.

02:19.890 --> 02:27.200
I'm going to open up unity and in the assets folder under models Here's my couch.

02:27.210 --> 02:31.080
Now one thing about it is our scale factor.

02:31.110 --> 02:34.940
How did we do with it scale back and blender.

02:35.070 --> 02:36.060
Well let's see.

02:36.120 --> 02:43.020
I'm going to take the couch and drag it over into the scene here and it pops into the center of the

02:43.020 --> 02:47.310
scene at 0 0 0 because I've dragged it over into the hierarchy.

02:47.400 --> 02:55.890
But let's take a look at it now it appears to be a little big but how do we know how do we know how

02:55.890 --> 02:58.350
big this should be here in Unity.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.430
Let's go back to Blendr and take a look at our scale.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.850
So remember we created that six feet scale here.

03:05.850 --> 03:11.600
If I select it I can see it's right down here on this layer here.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.290
If I press shift and click that layer we can turn it on.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.020
And now we can see here it is here's our six foot scale.

03:19.020 --> 03:23.760
So we need to do a little work in terms of getting that couch the proper scale.

03:23.790 --> 03:33.360
So I'm going to select both the couch and the feet and I'm going to move this pivot point to the center

03:33.360 --> 03:39.480
of the grid to that cursor so I can come over here to the Tools tab and press set origin and origin

03:39.480 --> 03:41.120
to 3D cursor.

03:41.130 --> 03:46.700
Now the origins of both of these objects are here in the center of the grid.

03:46.740 --> 03:55.200
So if I select them now the feet and the couch and press S and scale it down a bit we can begin to get

03:55.200 --> 03:59.610
a sense of how big this should be if this is the size of a person.

03:59.900 --> 04:05.520
I'm going to hit the three key and the five key maybe the one key to go to the side view.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.270
Here we go.

04:07.370 --> 04:11.720
And if I scale this down how big do you think that's going to be about like that.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.310
It's really up to you of course.

04:14.310 --> 04:24.180
And you can go and measure exactly how many centimeters a particular object is and make sure your units

04:24.180 --> 04:26.800
of measure are set over here.

04:26.800 --> 04:33.720
And the key to open up the properties panel and you can come in here and actually type in the exact

04:33.720 --> 04:35.670
dimensions in here.

04:35.850 --> 04:41.580
But I'm going to go with just kind of a gut feeling here I'm going to select these and let's say let's

04:41.580 --> 04:47.720
say if he's 6 feet tall that's about it right there.

04:47.970 --> 04:55.710
Let's try that and hit the five key to come out of orthographic view and I'll press shift and click

04:55.710 --> 04:58.380
this letter again to hide that.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.640
Now let's hit a and do this again.

05:00.720 --> 05:08.010
So if I had only export it out to that external exports folder I would have to delete what I had in

05:08.010 --> 05:09.810
unity and then bring it in again.

05:09.810 --> 05:16.090
But what I'm going to do is just over write it directly in unity so I can come up here and just go to

05:16.090 --> 05:22.220
a file export SBX choose selected objects.

05:22.220 --> 05:28.490
I'm in the unity project here and I'll just select couch again and export.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.990
And now it's going to overwrite what I had in unity.

05:33.070 --> 05:35.200
So let's come back to unity.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.120
And there's our couch.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.810
So now we can see that this is the actual size.

05:40.870 --> 05:47.580
It needs to be and of course we can move this around to wherever we want it to go.

05:47.580 --> 05:52.200
Notice here that the pivot point is in the center of the object.

05:52.200 --> 05:57.060
I've got the center pivot point or the center turned on.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.710
If I turn to pivot.

05:58.720 --> 06:06.240
Notice that the pivot point drops down to where I had it on the grid floor and also noticed over here

06:06.240 --> 06:12.720
that even though there is one file here if we scroll that little triangle down we have the two different

06:12.780 --> 06:22.190
objects here in Unity each with their own material that we created and named over in Blender.

06:22.230 --> 06:29.840
Also if we go into the materials folder here you can see we've got couch fabric couch wood here in the

06:29.840 --> 06:31.040
materials.

06:31.130 --> 06:37.910
So what of course I like to do is make sure that everything is all nice and tidy so I'm going to take

06:37.910 --> 06:44.390
these materials and move them over to my materials folder that I created and just get rid of this one

06:44.390 --> 06:47.770
here.

06:47.870 --> 06:53.810
So now I have the models in the models folder and the materials in the materials folder.

06:53.810 --> 06:54.190
All right.

06:54.200 --> 07:01.880
So now that we know how to get our model from Blender into unity we now need to deal with texturing

07:01.880 --> 07:02.360
it.

07:02.570 --> 07:06.320
And once again there's a couple of different ways that we can do this.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.830
So let's talk about those couple of ways here.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.680
I'm going to go back to blender and let's go back to our U-V editing screen lay out here and I'm going

07:15.680 --> 07:23.870
to center it up with the period key hit tab to go into edit mode and hit a to select all of my polygons

07:24.260 --> 07:31.160
and if I hit a Over here you can see all the U-V islands for my U-V map of the couch.

07:31.160 --> 07:37.010
Now what I want to do is find a material that looks kind of cheesy.

07:37.010 --> 07:43.130
I want to find a fabric texture that looks kind of old and nasty.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.370
And I found one on textures dot com.

07:47.540 --> 07:51.070
I've been using textures dot com for quite some time now.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.810
This is not an ad or a plug.

07:53.810 --> 07:59.210
I'm in no way connected with them whatsoever but I've used them for quite some time.

07:59.210 --> 08:02.780
It's a subscription service and I like it quite a bit.

08:02.780 --> 08:09.350
They do a good job of providing kind of a wide range of textures and giving them some good seamless

08:09.410 --> 08:10.360
textures.

08:10.370 --> 08:15.360
So what I've got is some downloaded textures here.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.960
I've got a fabric that I like.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.110
This one here.

08:20.290 --> 08:22.850
Now you have to admit that's kind of ugly.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.340
And that's exactly what I'm going for.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.150
And this is a seamless texture.

08:28.150 --> 08:35.080
Now if you tile this one right after the other one right next to the other you won't be able to see

08:35.110 --> 08:38.190
a seam very easily between the tiles.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.380
It flows into itself from one side to the other.

08:41.560 --> 08:46.370
And we'll talk about creating our own seamless textures here in a bit.

08:46.630 --> 08:52.330
But I just wanted to go through a couple of different ways of texturing your objects using this seamless

08:52.330 --> 08:53.500
texture.

08:53.500 --> 08:59.920
All right so let's go back to blender and I'm going to open up a note Ed. by clicking on this little

08:59.920 --> 09:04.960
tab right here and dragging down in the U-V editing screen layout.

09:04.980 --> 09:11.380
And I'm going to change this window from a movie image editor to a note editor and there we go.

09:11.380 --> 09:16.320
So we've created this couch fabric material on this couch.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.650
And here are the materials nodes.

09:18.790 --> 09:25.150
Now remember that I've got the cycle's render engine chosen here I think as I've said it's a really

09:25.150 --> 09:26.900
good render engine.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.380
I just have it on by default.

09:29.380 --> 09:37.540
Now when I open a new blender project if you have blender or anything else selected here your notes

09:37.540 --> 09:39.490
editor is going to look a little different.

09:39.670 --> 09:44.130
And keep in mind we're going to be using the materials and the rendering in unity.

09:44.140 --> 09:51.130
So what you choose here is not that important but what I want to do is bring in that fabric texture

09:51.220 --> 09:53.420
right into the note editor here.

09:53.530 --> 09:59.920
So when it come down here to add and choose texture and image texture.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.440
And here is a texture node.

10:02.470 --> 10:10.270
Now you can also press shift a and get the same menu here and click open and I'm going to browse to

10:10.270 --> 10:17.630
that textures folder I had with all my textures in it and here's the fabric pattern here.

10:17.770 --> 10:21.210
I can click on this icon and see all the images.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.370
So here it is.

10:22.580 --> 10:29.280
And I click open image and I'll go ahead and connect it up to the diffuse node right here.

10:29.290 --> 10:35.500
Now I can't see it yet in my viewport because I need to switch from solid to texture.

10:35.500 --> 10:43.360
And now if I tab back into object mode you can see the fabric on the object and it doesn't look too

10:43.360 --> 10:43.680
good.

10:43.680 --> 10:52.540
So what we need to do is actually duplicate or multiply the number of times this texture is on our object.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.230
So to do that I've got the properties window open over here.

10:56.410 --> 11:02.020
If you don't have this you can always click on the little tab right here that corner tab and drag a

11:02.020 --> 11:06.900
new one out and then change this to Properties window here.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.800
But I'm going to go ahead and.

11:08.890 --> 11:13.030
Right click on this click join area and put that back like that.

11:13.030 --> 11:20.440
So here I have a properties panel and I'll go to the material panel here and we can see we've got couch

11:20.650 --> 11:21.490
fabric.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.890
We've got an image texture hooked up right here.

11:26.230 --> 11:33.500
And if I click on the plus for the color you can see I've got that fabric pattern plugged in right there.

11:33.550 --> 11:41.710
Now if I go one panel over to the textures and switch if you're on brush switch to image texture.

11:41.740 --> 11:48.040
Now we can see the mapping settings for our image texture and right over here under scale I'm going

11:48.040 --> 11:51.520
to click and drag all three of these and maybe plug in like 5.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.840
Let's try that.

11:52.880 --> 11:59.260
Now you can see how it's been multiplied five times over the object and we're beginning to get a little

11:59.260 --> 12:01.520
bit more reasonable pattern on this.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.090
I think it's still a little too big.

12:03.100 --> 12:07.170
I'm going to drag select all three of these and type in 10.

12:07.560 --> 12:15.270
Yeah that's beginning to look OK I think that's about the right size we'd want for that right.

12:15.310 --> 12:22.760
Let's try a little bit smaller and try 12 what do you think too small.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.830
I'll go with it.

12:24.090 --> 12:31.290
So let's go with that for now and let's see if we can duplicate this pattern this way of texturing our

12:31.290 --> 12:33.590
object in unity.

12:33.600 --> 12:40.950
So in other words what we've done here is we've mapped the texture to the color channel of our material

12:41.550 --> 12:46.350
and then we've multiplied the scale to shrink that pattern down.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.640
Let's go try it over in unity.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.800
So I'll open up unity here.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.610
And here's our object.

12:52.620 --> 12:59.190
I'm going to go ahead and click on the couch and come over here and click on the couch fabric right

12:59.190 --> 13:02.460
here and now we can see that material here.

13:02.610 --> 13:07.490
And we've got an Al bedo slot here and that is the color channel.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.780
So what I gonna do is in.

13:09.780 --> 13:16.890
I'll just go to the assets folder here and I will open up my Finder window and here is that seamless

13:16.950 --> 13:21.510
fabric right here and I'm just going to click and drag that drag it right into the assets folder here

13:22.110 --> 13:26.760
and it will copy that file into the assets folder of unity.

13:26.820 --> 13:31.790
And there it is now going to take this and click and drag it right into the Alberto slot.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.610
And there we are.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.880
So basically same kind of a process.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.650
And I'm going to take the color swatch here and it's a little bit of a gray.

13:40.650 --> 13:47.070
I'm just going to move that right up to solid white when a material comes in from Blender it's going

13:47.070 --> 13:49.690
to have that slight gray to it.

13:49.800 --> 13:54.240
If you create a material directly in unity it'll be pure white.

13:54.240 --> 13:59.820
So if it's coming from Blender you're going to need to just move that up to white.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.910
So there is texture.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.900
Once again it's a little too big.

14:04.020 --> 14:08.900
So right down here under tiling This is where we're going to do our scale again.

14:09.060 --> 14:16.400
So what did we have at 12 in blender so I'll type in 12 tab 12 and hit enter.

14:16.590 --> 14:20.710
And now there is our fabric in unity.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.140
Now that works pretty well.

14:22.140 --> 14:27.390
If we just have an object that needs a repeating texture.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.590
This works pretty well.

14:29.600 --> 14:37.740
However what if I want dirt on this what if this couch needs to be really old and nasty and have stains

14:37.740 --> 14:45.340
on it and all in dirt How am I going to layer dirt on this over the fabric texture.

14:45.570 --> 14:53.190
Well in that instance we're going to need to use a paint program like Photoshop or GIMP or Corel Paint

14:53.220 --> 15:01.710
or Krita some sort of paint program where we can export the U.V. map out of Blendr build up the layers

15:01.710 --> 15:08.940
of textures in say Photoshop and then export them out of Photoshop and bring them into unity.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.560
So in the next video we'll take a look at doing that.
