WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:02.620
So what is it we're going to create.

00:02.760 --> 00:08.880
Well let's go back over to Blendr And what we're going to do is try and create an apartment scene.

00:08.890 --> 00:17.220
I go over to the Finder window here and I have in here some reference images and what I'd like to do

00:17.220 --> 00:28.650
is create an apartment scene that's kind of a rundown apartment in a not so great part of town and I've

00:28.650 --> 00:35.640
found these images out on google images just to give me kind of an idea of a sense of it.

00:35.640 --> 00:43.620
I don't know that I want it to be this run down but I don't know that I want it to be an art gallery

00:43.620 --> 00:47.400
per se but I like these windows here.

00:47.580 --> 00:54.020
I like the lay out of this with kind of the the main door coming in here and the kitchen.

00:54.030 --> 00:59.820
And then a living area and maybe a door over here and a door over here and it looks like they're windows

00:59.820 --> 01:01.060
over here.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.490
I kind of like the layout of this one.

01:04.360 --> 01:12.550
And then this is just a collection of junk and dirty dishes in the sink and maybe some cracked walls

01:12.550 --> 01:17.040
and things like this and maybe an old radiator and things like that.

01:17.040 --> 01:24.220
So I've just gathered these images together to give me a sense of what I'm trying to create.

01:24.640 --> 01:31.060
And I would really recommend this with any project that you do if you're going for realism then you

01:31.060 --> 01:37.420
really need reference images whether you find them on the Internet through google images or whatever

01:37.690 --> 01:40.990
whether you go out and take your own pictures.

01:41.020 --> 01:47.620
I really feel like you need to surround yourself with the imagery that you're trying to create even

01:47.620 --> 01:51.320
if you're trying to create a nonrealistic scene.

01:51.340 --> 01:57.700
Then I would suggest maybe trying to find images from a particular art movement maybe you want to look

01:57.700 --> 02:07.680
at painters of the Impressionist period or surrealism or maybe you're thinking about the curious Kuro

02:07.740 --> 02:11.260
lighting of the Dutch Masters.

02:11.260 --> 02:18.940
Maybe you're thinking of like Caravaggio and Rembrandt or whatever find as many reference images as

02:18.940 --> 02:25.810
you can so that you're grounding your work in reality even if it's other people's artwork.

02:25.810 --> 02:28.300
You're still grounding the work in reality.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.400
Anyway I think that reference images are really important.

02:31.420 --> 02:40.460
And every artist that you love and admire uses reference images I guarantee.

02:40.510 --> 02:46.780
Now I'd also like an object in my scene in Blender that gives me a sense of scale of how big a person

02:46.780 --> 02:47.890
is.

02:47.950 --> 02:53.820
So I'm going to come back here and a blender and what I'd like to do is just create a cube.

02:53.820 --> 03:03.220
I'll come over here to the Create tab and I'll click on cube and for this I want this to be six feet

03:03.220 --> 03:03.970
tall.

03:04.120 --> 03:11.920
So I'm currently using meters and that's really what I'm going to use mainly but for me I know as I

03:11.920 --> 03:19.900
said feet and inches so I'm thinking of just kind of an average male being six feet tall that just seems

03:19.900 --> 03:24.870
like a size that would be a good scale for my scene here.

03:24.940 --> 03:31.660
So I'm going to come over here to the scene panel and just briefly I'm going to switch it over to Imperial.

03:31.660 --> 03:38.080
And remember I said that when you change from one measure of unit to another the size of the objects

03:38.260 --> 03:42.850
doesn't change it's the size of the measurement that changes.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.020
So these are still the right size.

03:46.030 --> 03:51.880
Notice here that now it's six and a half feet tall so if I came over here to this field right here and

03:51.880 --> 04:01.710
just typed six in here and enter now this object is six feet tall so I also can change the action the

04:01.770 --> 04:04.970
while just change these to one each.

04:04.970 --> 04:05.410
And there we go.

04:05.410 --> 04:13.540
So now we've got a reference object that is exactly six feet tall and if I switch back to the metric

04:13.630 --> 04:21.520
system of measure here you can see that the Z is actually one point eight to nine metres so it's doing

04:21.520 --> 04:25.020
the conversion for us which is kind of nice.

04:25.030 --> 04:31.690
So now what I want to do is make sure that this is flat on the ground plane and that the pivot point

04:31.990 --> 04:33.520
is that the ground plane as well.

04:33.520 --> 04:40.000
I want to make sure that when I zero it out in the z axis that it's right on the ground.

04:40.230 --> 04:49.060
So many hit the period key on the numpad do frame this up and let me tab into Edit Mode press control

04:49.060 --> 04:56.620
tab to bring up the mesh select and I'll choose face and I'll just select that one face.

04:56.620 --> 05:04.120
Now I want to move the 3D cursor to that so press shift s and move the cursor to the selected right

05:04.120 --> 05:05.230
there.

05:05.230 --> 05:13.420
Now if I tab back into object mode I can come over here to the tools panel and set the origin to the

05:13.420 --> 05:15.190
3D cursor.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.390
Now the origin of this object is right at the bottom of it.

05:18.400 --> 05:26.880
So if I take this z axis the location here and zero it out that will pop it right down to the floor.

05:27.370 --> 05:32.860
Right down to the floor of my object there or my scene.

05:32.970 --> 05:41.210
So now that we have that let me get this cursor back in the center as well so I'll press shift s and

05:41.210 --> 05:45.090
put the cursor in the center of the grid.

05:45.090 --> 05:45.490
All right.

05:45.500 --> 05:51.210
So there we have our person height and the floor of our scene.

05:51.360 --> 05:59.030
Now I'm going to take this object this scale object and move it to another layer so I'll just select

05:59.030 --> 06:05.570
it and press the key and I'll move it to the last layer down here so you can see it right there.

06:06.080 --> 06:11.450
And I've got the floor over here in the first layer maybe I'll take this and move it down to this layer

06:11.450 --> 06:12.950
right down here.

06:12.970 --> 06:13.430
There we go.

06:13.430 --> 06:21.260
So now as I create new objects I can always come down here and press shift and click that layer and

06:21.260 --> 06:22.880
bring the floor back.

06:23.150 --> 06:27.970
Well let's go ahead and begin blocking the walls out for our scene.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.380
Let me come back here.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.890
Let me name this guy.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.150
Better give him a name.

06:32.150 --> 06:37.070
What do we want to call that I'll just call it six six feet.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.020
Scale.

06:38.060 --> 06:42.100
So I know that that's the 6 foot tall scale there.

06:42.340 --> 06:49.910
And I think I'd like to just begin blocking out the walls so I'll bring back the floor as well.

06:49.910 --> 06:56.630
I'll create a cube and let's begin moving it over here so I'll just bring it up a bit.

06:58.130 --> 07:01.880
I'll scale it in the X so press S and X and scale it.

07:01.880 --> 07:13.410
So it's a little bit thinner and I'll begin scaling these kind of like this and I'll also maybe tab

07:13.410 --> 07:18.030
into Edit Mode grab this face and start bringing it up a bit like this.

07:18.030 --> 07:24.780
Now I'll hit the end key so I can kind of see what the dimensions are of this so and the Z axis I've

07:24.780 --> 07:28.360
got four meters for switch over to Imperial.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.700
I've got 13 feet.

07:29.700 --> 07:36.400
So to me I think an 8 or 10 foot ceiling would be wise.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.750
Let's go with nine actually.

07:38.760 --> 07:47.960
So let me grab this and move it down a bit and I'll scale it in the Z until we get around 9 feet here.

07:49.110 --> 07:49.880
Let's try that.

07:49.890 --> 07:52.320
That may be a little bit tall but let's try it.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.790
So I'll bring that down.

07:56.170 --> 07:59.190
So it kind of sits on the ground.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.490
Once again I'll move this cursor.

08:01.720 --> 08:12.670
I can tap into edit mode select that bottom face press shift ask move the cursor to the selected and

08:12.670 --> 08:18.400
then move that pivot point under the Tools tab set the origin to the 3D cursor.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.550
And then if I drop that down to zero.

08:21.970 --> 08:27.790
Now it's going to sit right on that ground plane there.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.950
All right.

08:29.150 --> 08:34.330
So the apartment reference image that I want to use for this.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.280
And as I mentioned I kind of like this

08:39.980 --> 08:41.240
layout.

08:41.240 --> 08:49.970
So we've got this wall here and then a wall sticking out counters here and I'm thinking there are windows

08:49.970 --> 08:53.460
over here you can kind of see the light coming in here.

08:53.510 --> 08:57.890
So I want to try and replicate this layout.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.960
So if that's going to be my lay out then let's say

09:06.210 --> 09:12.230
let's say here's that wall that back wall that we were just looking at.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.190
It's currently 50 feet.

09:14.190 --> 09:16.350
I don't think that place is that big

09:20.060 --> 09:23.020
let's bring that Y-axis down press.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.990
And why reduce that a bit.

09:28.290 --> 09:35.470
And let's go ahead and take this unduplicated and I'm going to press shift D and enter.

09:35.490 --> 09:41.130
And then I'm going to move this around and maybe bring it over here for this wall coming over in the

09:41.130 --> 09:45.080
kitchen where that I think the front door would be.

09:45.120 --> 09:53.460
So if I press R and Z I can rotate around this axis and if I look over here in the Z-axis under rotation

09:53.460 --> 10:00.000
I can see I've turned it 78 degrees I'll just type in 90 and bring that over here

10:03.750 --> 10:05.750
something like this.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.800
That feels a little too big to me.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.750
So I feel like this wouldn't be 40 feet long.

10:15.750 --> 10:21.300
So I'm going to try and bring that in to maybe 30 feet or so.

10:23.150 --> 10:26.600
And let me Center that cursor again let me bring this wall in.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.180
So this is going to be the wall where the front door is

10:32.320 --> 10:40.270
and if I grab this face now and bring it in yeah let's call it something like that.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.820
So now this one is 30 feet long as well.

10:46.600 --> 10:52.580
Yes so maybe we're just dealing with a 30 foot square room here.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.650
Thirty feet by 30 feet.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.960
So I'm just trying to lay this out now.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.090
And let me grab this and duplicate it.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.120
Hit the x key.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.710
Move that over there.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.360
And then I'll just grab this.

11:12.450 --> 11:15.480
Chef de y.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.940
And then drag that over here so let's take a look at this.

11:18.950 --> 11:26.620
If this kind of feels right now one thing that we can do here just like we can move around in unity

11:27.430 --> 11:31.410
with the WASC D keys and the mouse.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.220
You can also do that here in Blender.

11:33.220 --> 11:42.040
So if it if I press shift F and then hit the tab key that'll drop me down to the ground and I can move

11:42.040 --> 11:48.430
around with the mouse and then press the W key and just move around the scene some kind of.

11:48.730 --> 11:51.970
See here's how tall I am with this guy.

11:51.970 --> 11:57.730
So I'm about six feet tall or at least maybe almost six feet tall here.

11:59.250 --> 12:05.530
And so this gives me a sense of the room so I can kind of move around here and say OK if I came in the

12:05.530 --> 12:08.630
front door I'd walk in here and see the kitchen.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.570
OK.

12:09.710 --> 12:13.790
I move in here and see the living area.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.090
Maybe it would be Windows over here.

12:16.150 --> 12:16.510
All right.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.740
This is feeling pretty good.

12:17.740 --> 12:21.910
So when I hit the escape key and there we go.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.900
So now I think that's going to work pretty well.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.950
Let me go back to that reference image and see what I think here.

12:30.130 --> 12:40.190
If this is 10 feet here and I'm thinking this is 20 feet then maybe yeah then maybe this is about 30

12:40.190 --> 12:42.610
by 30 all the way around.

12:42.620 --> 12:42.970
All right.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.870
Well let's give that a try.

12:44.870 --> 12:48.830
So I'll call this wall front door wall window

12:51.530 --> 12:56.000
wall doors and I'll call this wall back.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.110
Something like that.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.850
So let's let's name these now.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.770
This one our call.

13:01.770 --> 13:05.760
So I said Wall back.

13:05.930 --> 13:11.520
This one will be while front door this one over here.

13:11.530 --> 13:15.290
I'll call wall windows because we're going to put a couple of windows in here.

13:18.030 --> 13:29.240
This one over here will be called Wall doors because we'll have maybe a door to a bedroom and maybe

13:29.240 --> 13:32.520
a door to a bathroom or something like that.

13:32.540 --> 13:37.070
So for now I'm going to go ahead and select this one I'm going to hide it away because I want to be

13:37.070 --> 13:41.290
able to see into this room fairly easily so this is wall windows.

13:41.360 --> 13:47.650
I'm just going to click on the icon and turn that off so I can see in here a little easier.

13:47.960 --> 13:54.440
So once again I'll press shift F and then the tab key and that will put me on the ground and I can move

13:54.440 --> 13:59.630
around with WASC and try and get a sense of how this is going to feel.

14:00.660 --> 14:03.420
Yeah I think this is pretty good.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.980
We'll go with this for now and see if we need to alter it as we go.

14:07.980 --> 14:08.390
All right.

14:08.400 --> 14:16.230
So we've got a good beginning here we've established a pipeline from Blender to unity we've we've established

14:16.230 --> 14:17.900
our units of measure.

14:17.940 --> 14:25.140
And over here I'm going to switch back to metric now we've created a scale object here and we've got

14:25.260 --> 14:30.090
some basic walls and floor in to begin our scene.

14:30.410 --> 14:34.260
Now we should do one more thing before we close out of here.

14:34.260 --> 14:41.300
I'm going to go back to unity and I've begun creating in the assets folder collection of folders to

14:41.330 --> 14:43.850
organize my project.

14:43.850 --> 14:50.330
One of the things I want to do is create a new folder here by right clicking choosing create and folder

14:50.750 --> 14:54.000
and I want to just call this seems.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.260
Here we go.

14:55.400 --> 15:02.450
And in this I'm going to put all of my scenes so this scene right here I'm going to just call scene

15:02.480 --> 15:07.670
test 1 something like that so I'm just going to come up here to the file menu.

15:07.670 --> 15:13.870
Now you can't see that right now but I'm just going to come up to file and save scene.

15:13.940 --> 15:22.070
I can also just choose control or command s right in here and that will bring up the saved scene window.

15:22.320 --> 15:33.570
I'm going to click this and go into scenes and then I'll just call this scene test 0 1.

15:33.770 --> 15:38.410
So I'm just going to be creating a collection of test scenes as I go.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.330
So I click save.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.420
And there we go.

15:41.420 --> 15:44.300
So there's our scene inside the scenes folder.

15:44.330 --> 15:51.230
So as we go we're going to do more and more of this organizing and we're also going to do a good deal

15:51.230 --> 15:54.380
of organizing up here in the hierarchy as well.

15:54.710 --> 16:03.200
One of the things that's great about unity is it's very open to however you want to do things however

16:03.200 --> 16:04.310
you want to organize things.

16:04.310 --> 16:08.190
Which also means that it can get to be a complete mess too.

16:08.360 --> 16:16.340
So with these larger projects where we're creating a lot of objects within a scene it's really good

16:16.340 --> 16:19.520
to begin organizing your scene right up front.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.120
All right.

16:20.240 --> 16:28.150
So if we go back to Blendr we can see that we've already got a floor a couple of walls.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.770
We've got our scale object our six feet scale.

16:33.950 --> 16:36.410
We're ready to go ahead and begin creating our object.

16:36.410 --> 16:43.120
I think what I'm going to do instead of blocking out doors and walls and kitchen cabinets and things

16:43.130 --> 16:48.800
right now I think what I want to do is actually create a piece of furniture because I think in my head

16:48.800 --> 16:54.640
at least I can get a pretty good sense of how big a piece of furniture should be compared to this six

16:54.650 --> 16:57.110
