WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:04.670
As you can see I've added a few extra things to the scene.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.260
Let's go ahead and run the game and take a look around.

00:07.260 --> 00:14.300
Let me turn the ceiling back on over here under the inspector and then I'll hit play.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.850
And here we are in the room.

00:15.950 --> 00:24.810
Now you can see I've added this weight bench as well as a few boxes around the room here.

00:24.860 --> 00:29.610
I've also done a little bit of work over in the kitchen right here.

00:29.920 --> 00:36.530
And see I've added a stove a toaster a light fixture things like that.

00:36.650 --> 00:38.020
There's still more to do of course.

00:38.030 --> 00:46.130
I want this kitchen to be kind of cluttered and and messy but I wanted to talk a minute about the differences

00:46.130 --> 00:54.440
between this weight bench here and the sink that I've created for the bathroom in here.

00:54.650 --> 01:02.190
And the main difference is is that this object has only one material coming from Blender.

01:02.510 --> 01:07.200
And this object the sink has multiple materials.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.840
I just wanted to compare and contrast these two.

01:10.040 --> 01:17.900
Let's go back to Blender here and blender you can see when I've got Virtex paint mode on you can see

01:18.260 --> 01:22.210
the different colors I've assigned to the different parts of the weight bench.

01:22.430 --> 01:28.220
And if you look over here under the materials panel you can see it only has one material.

01:28.220 --> 01:35.300
And what that means is I only have to drag in the albedo the normal map and the metallic roughness map

01:35.630 --> 01:38.150
into just one material.

01:38.150 --> 01:45.110
If I have broken this up into multiple materials I'd have to drag the albedo and the normal map into

01:45.110 --> 01:49.300
each and every material and that can get tedious after a while.

01:49.340 --> 01:54.960
So if you have something like quick soul or substance painter it can really speed up the work flow.

01:54.980 --> 02:00.580
If you're just giving the object one material and then you're breaking it up by Virtex ID.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.840
So let's go over to substance painter and take a look at it there.

02:05.090 --> 02:09.680
Here in substance painter you can see that right over here under the texture set.

02:09.680 --> 02:18.230
I've only got one material the weight bench material from blender but because I gave it multiple Virtex

02:18.230 --> 02:26.810
paint colors I can for every group I have here I can choose a color here under pick color and choose

02:26.810 --> 02:30.930
which color I want to delineate which material.

02:31.510 --> 02:38.710
And here in substance painter I can give a different material type to each of the different objects.

02:38.720 --> 02:46.580
Now if we take a look at the sink let me open that up you can see over here that I used multiple materials

02:46.850 --> 02:55.640
for the sink basin the sink drain the faucet the legs and I'm not using the color picker here and this

02:55.640 --> 02:56.660
is fine.

02:56.660 --> 03:00.730
This is a completely valid way of doing things.

03:00.800 --> 03:07.790
And in fact if you're just using blender and a paint program like Photoshop or GIMP this is really the

03:07.790 --> 03:14.270
way you're going to need to do it because those materials are needed within unity to differentiate the

03:14.270 --> 03:22.430
different parts of the model so you can see here I've got the sink basin the sink drain the sink faucet

03:23.270 --> 03:30.210
and the legs all different materials with a U-V map assigned just to that material.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.920
So when we bring it into unity let's go back to unity.

03:34.220 --> 03:40.070
Let me turn off this ceiling for a minute and select just the sink.

03:40.070 --> 03:44.280
I've got the whole bathroom as one unit.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.350
Let me show you.

03:45.350 --> 03:50.480
I just I created the whole bathroom area as one unit.

03:50.480 --> 03:57.950
It's multiple objects but I brought it in from blender as a single FDX and therefore it comes in as

03:57.950 --> 04:00.610
one unit here in the hierarchy.

04:00.650 --> 04:07.760
I can scroll down and then select individual pieces so you can see the sink basin here.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.420
Here it is.

04:09.810 --> 04:19.960
And the sink faucet the drain etc are all individual not only individual materials I should point out

04:19.960 --> 04:22.070
but also individual objects.

04:22.070 --> 04:25.990
So like the legs here are their own object.

04:25.990 --> 04:33.370
So within each of these materials for the objects I've had to drag in the albedo the metallic and the

04:33.370 --> 04:40.660
normal into each one of these and it's not bad it's just that it takes a little longer.

04:40.690 --> 04:47.980
So something to think about as you set up your production pipeline and begin to think about the most

04:48.070 --> 04:51.740
efficient way to create and export your assets.
