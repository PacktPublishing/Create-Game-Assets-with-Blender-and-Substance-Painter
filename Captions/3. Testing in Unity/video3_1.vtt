00:00.700 --> 00:07.220
To add a little bit of dirt and grunge to this I've opened up a couple of grunge maps here that one's

00:07.230 --> 00:08.240
not bad.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.280
This one's pretty good.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.360
So I think I'll use maybe a combination of these two.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.090
I've gone ahead and added a little bit of texture for that handle.

00:19.490 --> 00:25.460
And now we can go ahead and just grab one of these grunge Mamselle work with this one here.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.520
Copy it.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.560
I'll paste it.

00:29.890 --> 00:36.280
And let's just take this and I'm just going to stretch this kind of to have it be the size of the map

00:36.280 --> 00:39.080
right about here like that.

00:39.280 --> 00:48.450
And then I will take the opacity down a bit like this and I'll also change the blend mode from normal

00:48.450 --> 00:51.330
to multiply right here.

00:51.330 --> 00:53.790
See how that works and that's looking pretty gross.

00:53.790 --> 00:54.930
That's not bad.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.120
OK.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.250
I think that maybe it's a bit too much on the counter tops.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.400
We'll have to see about that.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.980
Maybe I can bring the opacity down just a little bit more like that you.

01:06.990 --> 01:13.060
Let's try that let's try something like 25 here and then let's grab this other grunge map.

01:13.060 --> 01:20.040
I'll hit the M key for Marcie's select and just kind of drag an area I don't think I want this big splotch

01:20.070 --> 01:24.930
but everything else looks pretty good to me I'll just drag that area.

01:24.930 --> 01:29.040
Copy that and then I'll paste it here as well.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.680
And this I'll begin by trying to just stretch it over the whole thing.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.710
We'll see how this works.

01:34.710 --> 01:41.640
I may have to try and tile it but maybe this will work I'll switch it's blending mode to multiply as

01:41.640 --> 01:48.060
well take the opacity down to maybe 25 as well.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.470
That's not bad.

01:49.890 --> 01:52.350
That's looking relatively Gross.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.100
Let's give this a try and see how it looks.

01:55.200 --> 02:02.950
So all export and I'll save it out and go ahead and overwrite that color map that we created earlier.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.400
Here in Blender I'll go ahead and bring that in again.

02:07.440 --> 02:13.040
Go to my kitchen folder grab that color map and open it up and there we go.

02:13.410 --> 02:15.050
That's looking pretty gross.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.730
I have to admit I would not want to eat dinner there.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.540
So I think that will work.

02:23.730 --> 02:31.650
The countertops I'm going to have junk on them I think like plates and trash things like that.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.290
Not a whole lot but just enough to cover up some of that.

02:35.310 --> 02:36.870
Yes so I think that'll work.

02:36.870 --> 02:39.560
Let's go back and clean that texture map up.

02:39.570 --> 02:45.240
Now I'll hide these layers and I'll go ahead and combine these two.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.300
The grunge layers and just call them grunge.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.940
I will need to change that back to multiply one I mean make sure that's going to look OK.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.910
Yeah that's right.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.440
Now that I've combined those two into one layer the grunge.

03:00.440 --> 03:09.300
I need to combine the UVM apps into one now so I select those two and control or command e to combine

03:09.300 --> 03:10.290
those.

03:10.290 --> 03:20.220
Now I can go back to my magic wand tool and begin selecting around here so that we can delete the grunge

03:20.220 --> 03:26.400
that we don't need that's extending out beyond the actual texture islands.

03:26.490 --> 03:28.870
So it looks like I got them all there.

03:28.890 --> 03:33.490
I'll go ahead and contract the selection by two pixels.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.050
Then I'll choose the grunge.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.550
There it is.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.440
Hit delete.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.420
There we go.

03:41.950 --> 03:47.710
Now I can take everything and export this U.V. map so I will export.

03:47.710 --> 03:55.250
Now over here in Blendr I'll bring it in one last time just to check it.

03:55.310 --> 03:56.590
And there we go.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.930
Now let's deal with this handle here.

03:59.930 --> 04:07.880
Remember I said that we only needed to do this one time because every handle we duplicate off of this

04:07.880 --> 04:14.690
is going to just sit right underneath this U.V. map so they'll all have the same texture and that's

04:14.690 --> 04:17.650
OK because it's such a small part in the scene.

04:17.930 --> 04:28.310
But let me go ahead and press the L key to select it and now maybe I can hit Control 1 and 5 and also

04:28.310 --> 04:29.450
hit the Z key.

04:29.600 --> 04:37.670
And let's just begin putting these in place so a press shift D and X and just begin moving these where

04:37.670 --> 04:39.650
they need to go.

04:39.680 --> 04:47.360
I've duplicated this one and I'm just going to move it over here and rotate it with our 9 0 and then

04:47.360 --> 04:49.330
move it into place here.

04:50.070 --> 04:53.830
Duplicate it and move it in the X and say get it right here.

04:53.860 --> 05:00.850
Now I can hit the L key and select this one as well and begin duplicating these and moving them into

05:00.850 --> 05:03.420
place on the cabinets here.

05:03.430 --> 05:09.640
So duplicate that and move this up maybe there are going to be like down here

05:12.710 --> 05:14.710
like this.

05:14.940 --> 05:21.660
And then maybe we only need one for this cabinet so I'll just hover over this one and hit the L key.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.980
Duplicate it and we'll maybe put it right here.

05:26.010 --> 05:33.330
So now you can see that even though we've duplicated those all over it's all still only being represented

05:33.330 --> 05:36.870
in the U-V map by one U-V Island.

05:36.870 --> 05:42.620
So I think now we're about ready to export these out of Blendr and take them into unity.

05:42.620 --> 05:46.650
However there's still all one material right.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.730
It's all one object and that's fine.

05:48.780 --> 05:54.960
But the problem is is we've got all one material and we're going to want to be able to differentiate

05:55.020 --> 05:58.980
the different areas by different materials in unity.

05:58.980 --> 06:06.990
So I think we need a material for the wood a material for the counters and a material for all the handles.

06:06.990 --> 06:15.060
So for the countertops Let's tap into that mode and I'll just hover over this and press the L key and

06:15.060 --> 06:21.570
I've got it delimited by the normals which means it will select everything even though there are seams

06:21.570 --> 06:22.150
there.

06:22.530 --> 06:26.760
And I'll do that with the backslashes and that countertop.

06:26.820 --> 06:33.390
So let's give this a materialist just call these countertops all click the plus button up here click

06:33.390 --> 06:41.180
new and we'll call this counter-top OK.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.070
And we need to click a sign right.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.270
OK so we already have the cabinet.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.390
That's fine.

06:47.390 --> 06:50.880
We just need these handles now so let's go ahead and grab these.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.680
Now I could go through and hit L and select each one of these.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.870
Another way to do it is I could maybe select it in here.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.590
That would catch all of those.

07:01.590 --> 07:05.300
So if I click this little button here.

07:05.890 --> 07:13.630
And then when I can do is hit the B key board or select and border select all of this right there and

07:13.630 --> 07:17.280
that selects all of them in the 3D view as well.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.040
So now I can hit the plus button over here.

07:21.040 --> 07:31.400
New material will call this cabinet handles and we go and assign.

07:31.590 --> 07:40.830
Now we should have if we hit cabinets here we can select them and there they are de-select countertops

07:40.830 --> 07:44.390
select de-select and handles.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.280
Good.

07:45.300 --> 07:45.810
All right.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.980
We have all our materials here.

07:48.600 --> 07:55.080
So now I think we are about ready to export these out of Blendr I'll hit the achy disliked everything

07:55.400 --> 08:01.620
and because it's in its own layer we can select everything and just get what we want here and then I'll

08:01.620 --> 08:04.870
go to file export FDX.

08:05.040 --> 08:12.600
I will choose selected objects and I'll go ahead and this time take it right into the unity assets folder.

08:12.600 --> 08:24.680
Here we go right into here and I'll call this kitchen cabinets underscore L for the left side of the

08:24.680 --> 08:25.510
kitchen.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.430
There we go.

08:27.330 --> 08:33.120
And export here in Unity You can see the object already brought in.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.000
Let's go ahead and bring the textures in as well.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.520
Here and my textures folder.

08:37.530 --> 08:44.480
I've got a kitchen folder and here is that color map I'll drag that in.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.750
There it is.

08:46.750 --> 08:47.160
All right.

08:47.170 --> 08:48.390
Let's start bringing these in.

08:48.400 --> 08:53.730
I'll drag the cabinets into the hierarchy and there they are.

08:53.750 --> 08:59.680
I'll come over here and open up these materials and I'll just take each one of these two pure white

09:01.510 --> 09:09.240
and now I'll drag this one texture map into the Al-Bayda slot of each of these materials.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.980
We're going to use the same texture map for each one.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.100
There we go.

09:16.620 --> 09:24.240
All right so there we go we've got our handles are really nasty countertops and our cabinets.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.150
Now we need to adjust the materials.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.740
But before we do we really ought to bring a light source in here it's looking kind of dull here so I

09:31.740 --> 09:32.250
will.

09:32.350 --> 09:34.890
Right click in the hierarchy.

09:34.890 --> 09:39.890
Go to light and I'll just go ahead and create a point light at least for now.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.590
And let's bring that out here.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.600
Bring it up near the ceiling like that.

09:48.610 --> 09:55.120
So we kind of have a light source similar to what we might have in the final setup.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.110
Now let's work on getting the materials a little better.

09:58.110 --> 10:04.510
I think even though this is dirty and kind of nasty these materials would have a little bit more of

10:04.510 --> 10:05.770
a shine to them.

10:05.800 --> 10:12.580
So if I choose my kitchen cabinets object and come over here this is the handles these are going to

10:12.580 --> 10:23.470
have a little bit more of a shine to them I think they are metallic If we zoom in here we can see the

10:23.470 --> 10:30.140
reflection in them that may be a little much something like that perhaps.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.640
All right.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.710
Counter-top it is not metallic so I'm going to keep this fairly low.

10:37.810 --> 10:48.980
But we may be able to see a little bit of reflection in here just ever so slightly like that something

10:48.980 --> 10:55.820
like that and then the word is well we should probably have a little bit of shine to that.

10:55.820 --> 11:01.440
It's not very metallic and it shouldn't be that shiny.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.960
Let me bring it back.

11:05.870 --> 11:10.140
Something kind of like that maybe yeah.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.990
Now we can also create a normal map for this texture map.

11:14.990 --> 11:18.830
Let's go do that in Photoshop and then bring it in.

11:18.830 --> 11:26.310
So back here in Photoshop I'm going to go ahead and select all of these and create a group or call this

11:26.310 --> 11:34.520
group originals and then I'll take all of these again and press alt and click and drag.

11:34.530 --> 11:41.040
Outside of that group to duplicate all of these I'll turn that off and now I'll collapse all these into

11:41.040 --> 11:45.110
one with control or command E and I'll call this normal.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.610
That's our normal map.

11:47.610 --> 11:55.280
Now come over here to filter 3D generate normal map.

11:55.430 --> 11:57.250
I'll change this to cube.

11:57.920 --> 12:04.590
And here we go we can kind of see some bump happening in here.

12:06.140 --> 12:09.900
On the textures that may be all we need.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.300
Let's give it a try.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.800
I'll hit OK then I'll export this out.

12:17.350 --> 12:23.620
And instead of underscores C Let's call this underscore in for normal.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.750
And now let's take it into unity.

12:25.910 --> 12:28.580
Here it is here in the kitchen folder.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.760
I'll bring that in.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.390
Let's select our kitchen cabinets and drag this into the normal map for each of these if we think we

12:37.390 --> 12:38.490
need it.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.510
Let me get fixed now here.

12:40.690 --> 12:46.120
So there's the cabinets and countertop I'll go and put it in the countertop.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.950
I don't think I'll put it in the cabinet handles material.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.110
I don't think we need it there.

12:52.360 --> 12:57.790
So you can kind of see I don't know if you can see it but there's a little bit of bump happening on

12:57.790 --> 12:59.490
these which is what we want.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.410
That's good.

13:01.110 --> 13:03.060
All right so I mean to hit the play button.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.710
And let's go into the kitchen and see how it looks.

13:09.950 --> 13:10.610
Oh yeah.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.450
Wow.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.580
Those are nasty.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.280
All right.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.750
So there we have our kitchen cabinets.

13:20.910 --> 13:26.730
Now before the next video I'm going to go ahead and finish up the cabinets here in the kitchen add a

13:26.730 --> 13:29.550
few other things like the sink and the stove.

13:29.550 --> 13:33.840
I'm also going to add a few other assets around the apartment.

13:33.840 --> 13:39.570
I've got a weight bench I need to put in here I'm going to put the bathroom in and maybe a couple of

13:39.570 --> 13:41.620
the doors and some other things.

13:41.670 --> 13:48.750
So in the next video I just want to talk again about Virtex paint and color I.D. and substance paint

13:48.750 --> 13:54.730
her as opposed to breaking up the parts of the model into different materials.

13:54.870 --> 14:00.810
So if you're bringing the model directly into unity you're going to need separate materials that you

14:00.810 --> 14:02.620
can work with.

14:02.670 --> 14:09.360
However if you use something like substance paint or you can give that one object all one material and

14:09.360 --> 14:12.450
break it up by Virtex paint.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.980
We've seen that before.

14:13.980 --> 14:18.610
I just want to show you as it's applied to a model that's a little bit more complex.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.770
So we'll do that coming up next.
