00:00.720 --> 00:06.970
Well I think we're to the point where we can maybe build the game and run around and see how it looks.

00:06.990 --> 00:08.950
There is of course more that we can do.

00:08.970 --> 00:15.460
You know I've added the boxes and some pill bottles and cigarettes and other things in the scene.

00:15.570 --> 00:22.640
But I think we can go ahead and adjust our players settings and build the game just to see how it looks.

00:22.650 --> 00:29.710
So if you want to build the game what you can do is come over here to file build settings.

00:30.050 --> 00:34.960
Of course you're going to need the pro version of unity to build a couple of these kinds of games.

00:34.970 --> 00:40.850
But many of them can be built with the Personal Edition and the unity splash screen will just be what

00:40.850 --> 00:47.720
the user sees first using the pro edition will allow you to get rid of that unity splash screen and

00:47.720 --> 00:50.940
also will add some more advanced features as well.

00:51.170 --> 00:55.300
I'm going to go ahead and build a Mac version since I'm here on a Mac.

00:55.300 --> 01:02.090
It already knows what I'm using here so it's already brought up the Mac OS X choice for me what I need

01:02.090 --> 01:06.470
to do is put the scenes I want to build appear in this window.

01:06.470 --> 01:15.530
So if you have multiple scenes and youre in code switching from one scene or level in your game to another

01:15.860 --> 01:17.910
you need to bring them up into here.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.480
I'll just go into my scenes folder and I've got these test scenes I've been using as we've been going

01:23.480 --> 01:24.500
along.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.840
This is the current one I'll just take this scene test up into here and drop it.

01:29.840 --> 01:37.230
So let's say this was our splash screen scene or level that would go first.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.770
You can see here that it's got the number zero here.

01:41.030 --> 01:44.930
Let's say I had other scenes or levels I wanted to bring in.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.560
I could just drag them in one right after the other.

01:49.800 --> 01:56.340
And you can see here that they've got ID numbers 0 1 2 3 and they'll go on up and you can re arrange

01:56.340 --> 01:58.500
these just by clicking and dragging.

01:58.770 --> 02:06.390
And so in code you would reference these ID numbers when you want to load a scene going to go ahead

02:06.390 --> 02:08.920
and select this and hit the delete key.

02:09.090 --> 02:12.260
And for each of these I'll just delete them out of there.

02:12.420 --> 02:16.410
And now we're left with the one scene that we want to use.

02:16.410 --> 02:22.470
Another thing I can set up from this window are the player settings and what I want to do is adjust

02:22.890 --> 02:30.840
the resolution of the player settings or of the view and I can come down here and click on player settings.

02:30.840 --> 02:37.740
And over here you can see I've got my default screen with already set for 12 a and my screen height

02:38.010 --> 02:43.220
set for 720 so you'll probably see it when you come in here.

02:43.260 --> 02:49.830
The first time you'll probably see it with default is full screen already checked and I don't like that

02:49.830 --> 02:56.550
so I'm going to uncheck that and just plug in what I want the screen height and width to be all right.

02:56.550 --> 02:59.310
So I have that taken care of.

02:59.310 --> 03:03.890
Now I can come over here to this screen and just build my game.

03:03.990 --> 03:10.590
So I click on build and I've already created a build's folder here so I'm going to go ahead and just

03:10.710 --> 03:12.520
save this in that folder.

03:12.710 --> 03:13.700
I'll hit save.

03:13.770 --> 03:17.290
I've already done this once before so I'll hit replace.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.220
And there it goes.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.050
So now it is built the game.

03:21.060 --> 03:25.050
All browse to that folder.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.640
And now to play the game.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.400
All I need to do is double click the file.

03:29.400 --> 03:37.710
Now if this was a Windows machine you would have the build file or the C plus a folder and the folder

03:37.710 --> 03:42.060
would just have a few files in it that the Hexie needs to run.

03:42.060 --> 03:47.970
So just know that on a Windows machine you're going to need both that executable and that folder of

03:47.970 --> 03:49.590
extra files.

03:49.590 --> 03:59.380
So I will double click on this and I think I'll run it at beautiful as opposed to fantastic.

03:59.380 --> 04:06.250
I love the terms there just since I'm recording here it might bog it down a bit if I go too high.

04:06.250 --> 04:13.190
So I've got the windowed option checked and I'll click play.

04:13.230 --> 04:17.460
Here is the game loading up.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.870
And there we are.

04:18.950 --> 04:25.870
So I can run around with WASC and just take a look at my scene.

04:25.940 --> 04:29.330
So this is the actual build of the game.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.540
We can go in here and take a look at the kitchen.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.930
And here's the living room.

04:36.110 --> 04:40.060
The boxes and I put some blinds on the windows there.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.410
So there we go.

04:41.650 --> 04:44.060
We've got our finished level.

04:44.260 --> 04:50.310
I'll go ahead and exit out of this quit.

04:50.530 --> 04:51.510
And there we go.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.090
So I hope this course has been helpful to you.

04:55.090 --> 05:02.410
I've certainly enjoyed going through the process of using blender and unity together in a very integrated

05:02.410 --> 05:04.940
way to build a game level.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.170
Well thank you again and take care.
