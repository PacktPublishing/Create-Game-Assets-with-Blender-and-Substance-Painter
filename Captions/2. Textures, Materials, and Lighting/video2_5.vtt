00:00.930 --> 00:06.210
Well have brought all the textures in for the walls just to see how they look here and they're looking

00:06.210 --> 00:07.730
pretty good.

00:07.740 --> 00:13.010
Let's test this now and take it into unity and just see how it looks.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.440
So now we already have the walls over here in Unity right.

00:17.460 --> 00:23.040
I just U-V mapped and applied the textures to these three walls here.

00:23.190 --> 00:30.870
Living room left windows and back here are the models that we've brought in the FBI X Files that we've

00:30.870 --> 00:39.730
brought in if we take a look at this and look at say one of the walls say living back right here.

00:39.930 --> 00:45.240
We can't just delete this out of here if I right click on this and hit delete.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.380
Nothing happens right.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.490
We can't get rid of this per se this is all one object.

00:50.490 --> 00:56.970
This is all one file we could if we wanted to come in here and select an individual wall up in the hierarchy

00:57.420 --> 01:03.900
and we could delete this if we wanted to and then bring it back in individually but it would be a different

01:03.920 --> 01:05.600
FDX file.

01:05.670 --> 01:11.370
I think what I'm going to do is just export it out and overwrite this with the new versions of the objects.

01:11.670 --> 01:20.400
So back in Blender I will select the layer that has just the walls on it so I can just hit a and select

01:20.400 --> 01:21.340
everything.

01:21.690 --> 01:29.130
I'll then come up here to file export FDX selected objects only.

01:29.330 --> 01:37.850
This time I will browse right into that model's folder and all exported out right over that existing

01:37.850 --> 01:42.980
walls FDX Let's see what happens I'll hit export.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.230
And there we go.

01:44.590 --> 01:45.630
Let's go take a look.

01:45.850 --> 01:51.920
So here in the unity project here is that was FDX that we just imported in.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.080
But here's the question is that the one that we imported or is it the old one.

01:56.290 --> 02:01.300
Only one way to find out is to bring in our textures and see if they fit.

02:01.300 --> 02:07.470
So let's go to our textures folder and I will right click and choose.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.690
Important new asset.

02:09.770 --> 02:13.930
And let's go to that textures folder in our project.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.900
Jews the walls.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.910
And here it is.

02:16.910 --> 02:17.660
Walls.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.160
Paper.

02:19.370 --> 02:20.870
See right here.

02:21.590 --> 02:23.260
Let's see how it works.

02:23.270 --> 02:25.170
Import.

02:25.240 --> 02:32.620
Now if we select one of our walls right here and this is the back I'll bring that white level all the

02:32.620 --> 02:37.480
way up to pure white and I'll take the color map and drag it into the Al-Bayda.

02:37.810 --> 02:41.320
And sure enough that's the one.

02:41.340 --> 02:44.870
So now we can go ahead and do these other walls as well.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.100
How about the living room left.

02:53.260 --> 03:00.200
Drop that in and how about over here the one with the windows

03:03.610 --> 03:07.740
increase that to white and drag that in.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.120
So there we go.

03:10.430 --> 03:13.640
So what have we done here what have we what have we learned.

03:13.640 --> 03:23.030
Well what I'm trying to do is go through several different processes for texturing and arranging your

03:23.030 --> 03:25.720
materials and your U-V maps.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.420
We've talked about several different methods of doing that.

03:29.420 --> 03:36.870
We've looked at using a repeatable texture directly in unity when we first began texturing the couch.

03:36.950 --> 03:44.950
We've looked at exporting out U.V. maps to photoshop and layering our textures over that with the couch

03:44.960 --> 03:50.510
we brought it in with two objects and material for each of the objects with the coffee table we brought

03:50.510 --> 03:55.700
in one object to materials applied to that one object.

03:55.700 --> 04:03.550
We did the same thing with the walls but we put the U-V islands of separate objects all on one U-V map

04:04.400 --> 04:12.080
so you can see there are a lot of ways to organize and export your objects with their materials and

04:12.080 --> 04:13.260
with the textures.

04:13.580 --> 04:21.380
And remember we also export it out of Blender using Virtex colors so that a program like substance painter

04:21.590 --> 04:25.850
can see those different areas as individual materials.

04:26.090 --> 04:30.850
So we've actually covered quite a lot here now that we know this is going to work.

04:30.860 --> 04:40.820
Let's go back to photoshop and clean up our U-V map here in Photoshop I can select that U-V layer go

04:40.820 --> 04:49.340
to my magic wand tool with the W key or clicking right over here selecting Schiff's select this area

04:49.400 --> 04:56.380
maybe and maybe shift select these areas in here with doors and the windows.

04:56.660 --> 05:04.710
And now if we take all of these layers here I'm going to Allt and click and drag these.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.890
So they duplicate.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.140
Now I'm going to press control or command e.

05:09.170 --> 05:12.680
So they all merge down into one.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.440
And these.

05:13.440 --> 05:24.890
Now I can put in a group call it say originals and hide that with those various selected.

05:24.890 --> 05:31.610
I'll go ahead and contract the selection a bit by going to select modify contract and are contracted

05:31.610 --> 05:32.660
by two frames.

05:32.660 --> 05:39.110
Let's say there we go just to give you the islands a little bit of breathing room and I'll go back to

05:39.110 --> 05:47.150
this merged layer and hit the delete key and we can go ahead and add a new layer and drag it down to

05:47.150 --> 05:48.200
the bottom.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.210
Make sure we've got black over here.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.630
Go to the paint bucket.

05:51.650 --> 05:56.270
I'm going to de-select everything I'm going to pest control or command d to de-select everything and

05:56.270 --> 06:00.000
then I'm going to paint in here so it paints the whole layer.

06:00.260 --> 06:09.830
And now I can turn off the movies and there is the map we can export this out by going to file export

06:10.490 --> 06:12.500
Export as.

06:12.570 --> 06:21.280
And let's go ahead and put it in the unity project in the assets folder and right in that textures folder

06:21.290 --> 06:30.010
Here's that walls color map so we'll just overwrite that completely export and replace.

06:30.040 --> 06:37.470
And now if we go back to unity there it is and it's applied to our objects.

06:37.550 --> 06:44.600
So in the next few videos I will be just cranking out more assets more objects to go in our scene here

06:44.900 --> 06:48.790
and using the same processes that we've already used.

06:48.800 --> 06:55.070
So hopefully if you have any questions or something wasn't particularly clear you'll see it done again

06:55.100 --> 06:56.570
and it'll begin to click.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.220
So let's keep on moving.
