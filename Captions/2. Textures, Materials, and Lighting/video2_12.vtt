00:01.130 --> 00:08.420
Another thing I'd like to do is add an area rug in here kind of thrown down and at an angle.

00:08.420 --> 00:12.200
So let's take a look at how we could use an alpha channel.

00:12.200 --> 00:22.510
And over here in the unity materials we'll use the cut out rendering mode to create an area rug here.

00:22.510 --> 00:22.740
All right.

00:22.750 --> 00:26.410
So let's go back to blender and give that a shot.

00:26.470 --> 00:32.560
Go ahead and take this television and let's move it over to the second layer so I'll just press and

00:32.560 --> 00:39.040
click the second layer here and that puts it with all of the other objects here and I'll just begin

00:39.280 --> 00:41.210
adding to this as I go.

00:41.500 --> 00:52.120
So in a free layer Let's go ahead and create a polygon plain here and I'll scale it up just a bit.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.800
So it kind of fits the kind of rug I want to use.

00:55.810 --> 01:03.400
I'm going to scale it in the wind just a bit and scaled in the acts a little like this something like

01:03.400 --> 01:04.120
that.

01:04.120 --> 01:10.450
Now currently this is just one polygon if I hit the tab key and go into edit mode you can see that it's

01:10.450 --> 01:14.140
just this one polygon and that's all it is.

01:14.230 --> 01:20.290
When creating game assets of course the idea is to try and do it with as few polygons as possible the

01:20.290 --> 01:24.770
more polygons in the level the more resources are used.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.840
And that can slow the game down.

01:26.940 --> 01:35.200
However for something like this I've found that objects with just one face in unity can cause problems

01:35.200 --> 01:41.800
with seeing the texture on the objects so sometimes if you just have one polygon you can't see the texture

01:41.830 --> 01:42.660
in unity.

01:42.670 --> 01:47.350
So what I'll do is just hit the W key and subdivide it.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.710
So we have now four polygons and that won't kill us.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.430
That won't drag the game down or anything.

01:53.590 --> 02:00.730
So now that we have that I will go ahead and press control a and click scale to apply the transforms

02:00.730 --> 02:01.570
there.

02:01.610 --> 02:04.780
Now let's go over to the editing screen.

02:04.800 --> 02:12.050
Lay out I will tab into Edit Mode hit you and unwrap and there is our U.V. map.

02:12.220 --> 02:19.270
So now that we have this let's go ahead and export out a U.V. map I'll just export out a map at say

02:19.300 --> 02:29.680
2048 here and I'll put this in my textures folder and let's go ahead and call this Rugge.

02:29.780 --> 02:33.760
I'll create a new folder for it as well.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.870
And let's just call this Rugge underscore Uvas.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.050
Here we go.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.210
And now let's go take a look at it in Photoshop.

02:43.250 --> 02:51.200
I'll get a file and open to open that up in Photoshop find it in my textures folder and here it is.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.510
So there is the map.

02:56.930 --> 02:59.320
I'll go ahead and open up a texture.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.630
I found already here it is.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.800
So I'm going to use this one here for the rug.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.810
Now it has an alpha channel on it.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.390
So here let me show you what I mean.

03:10.400 --> 03:17.070
I'll open it up and you can see here that we can see through this part of the image.

03:17.090 --> 03:22.840
I'll go ahead and select it all and copy it and bring it over here and paste it here.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.990
Now it turns out this is pretty small.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.410
So this one may not work.

03:27.410 --> 03:32.950
I'm going to have to scale it up and I don't really like to do that but let's give it a try.

03:32.960 --> 03:41.830
I'm going to scale this up because the more you scale things up the more you lose resolution in the

03:41.830 --> 03:42.460
image.

03:42.610 --> 03:44.730
But let's give it a try.

03:44.740 --> 03:49.330
So I'm in a place this here over the U-V map over the U-V island.

03:49.420 --> 03:54.640
I'll drag it down below so we can see it underneath the U-V wires.

03:54.820 --> 04:03.790
So I'll turn off the movies and I'll export it out as a color map here in the rug folder I'll call it

04:03.790 --> 04:07.090
Rugge underscore see for a color map.

04:07.090 --> 04:13.110
Let's go ahead and export that object out to unity and see how it looks in unity.

04:13.120 --> 04:22.200
So back in Blendr I'll tab back into object mode and I'll create a new material I'll call this rug and

04:22.200 --> 04:28.320
I'll also change the name of the object and call it Rugge as well so they match.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.790
So we can keep track of them in unity.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.180
Let's also deal with the scale.

04:35.180 --> 04:39.760
Now let me go back to the default view.

04:40.060 --> 04:47.800
Bring back the layer with all of the furniture in it and let's shrink this down so it will fit into

04:47.800 --> 04:50.810
the room a little better maybe something like this.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.330
All right.

04:52.510 --> 04:59.520
So I'll go ahead and make sure the scale is applied again with control a scale.

04:59.650 --> 05:08.120
And now let's export it out file export FDX selected object.

05:08.180 --> 05:13.900
Let's put it in the assets folder and we'll call this Roug and there it goes.

05:15.080 --> 05:20.590
All right let's go to unity there's our object let's bring in that texture.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.580
I'll go to a finder and let's bring that in.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.400
Here it is Roug underscore see.

05:26.390 --> 05:27.520
I'll bring that in.

05:28.900 --> 05:40.590
And now if we take the rug object and drag it in here it is it's sitting right on the same plane as

05:40.590 --> 05:48.130
the floor and therefore we're getting this strange kind of flickering and that's CSY fighting sense.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.710
They're both on top of each other.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.890
They're actually fighting each other as to which one is going to be seen on top.

05:55.890 --> 05:59.030
We don't want that so let's raise this up just a bit.

05:59.550 --> 06:03.480
And then let's take it and put it over here say like that.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.420
All right.

06:05.530 --> 06:11.020
Now in the material for the rug I'll take that to pure white.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.600
I'll come into the textures folder and drag this into the Al-Bayda.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.870
And now we can see it there.

06:19.060 --> 06:25.210
And that looks pretty good except for the areas around the rug.

06:25.270 --> 06:31.130
What this do is change the rendering mode from opaque to cut out.

06:31.170 --> 06:35.810
And now that makes the outside of the rug clear.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.670
So it's just the shape of the rug.

06:38.850 --> 06:39.960
All right that looks pretty good.

06:39.960 --> 06:45.900
Let's take that and kind of drag it over here maybe rotate it a bit like this so it just kind of looks

06:45.900 --> 06:48.960
like it's been haphazardly placed.

06:48.970 --> 06:54.110
I like to put things kind of at a strange angle because humans do that.

06:54.480 --> 07:01.260
It's very easy in a computer program like blender or unity to put things on axis so we can you know

07:01.440 --> 07:09.210
begin to kind of turn things a bit make them a little bit off axis so that they don't seem quite as

07:09.540 --> 07:11.550
computer made.

07:11.670 --> 07:19.020
We're giving our objects just a little bit of life here like the place has been lived in and pushed

07:19.020 --> 07:27.240
around and things aren't quite lined up correctly and that and I kind of like that so we've got our

07:27.300 --> 07:31.050
rug in here set up.

07:31.350 --> 07:35.310
But I think it needs a little bit of texture a little bit of depth to it.

07:35.310 --> 07:38.680
If we run the game let's take a look at how this looks.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.720
Well I'm upside down.

07:42.150 --> 07:48.030
If we come over here and take a look at this it looks pretty good but I think we can give it a little

07:48.030 --> 07:52.110
bit of depth with something like a normal map.

07:52.470 --> 08:00.580
Let's take a look at how we might do that if we go back into Photoshop we can generate a normal map

08:00.580 --> 08:01.090
from here.

08:01.090 --> 08:09.400
So this layer Let's call the color map and if I duplicate this with alt click and drag I can make this

08:09.400 --> 08:11.330
when say the normal map.

08:11.560 --> 08:20.540
And with this selected I'll come up here to filter three-D and generate normal map.

08:20.660 --> 08:30.590
So if I click that it brings up this dialog window and you can see the preview of it here.

08:31.120 --> 08:36.790
You can invert it invert the height here so if I click that you can see that these things now are pushed

08:36.850 --> 08:38.440
out.

08:38.440 --> 08:48.010
I can switch here to view it from object to say cube and we can take a look at it on a flat surface.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.340
Click here to zoom in yeah something like that.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.480
That looks pretty good.

08:54.380 --> 08:57.330
So let's say we go with that click OK.

08:58.360 --> 09:04.260
And there is our normal map now we didn't get any information behind here.

09:04.480 --> 09:11.590
What I need to do is really put a black layer behind this like I have for other texture maps so let

09:11.590 --> 09:18.520
me undo that and I'll create a new black layer behind here.

09:20.110 --> 09:25.810
With the paint bucket and now I'll take these two layers.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.740
Copy them.

09:26.740 --> 09:34.480
Move them up and these two all collapse down with control or command E and we'll call this the normal

09:34.560 --> 09:35.800
nap.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.470
And now let's try that again.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.690
I'll go to filter 3D and generate normal map.

09:41.860 --> 09:42.410
There we go.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.440
That's a little better.

09:44.440 --> 09:44.880
All right.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.640
So I'll say OK.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.980
And there is our normal map.

09:49.090 --> 09:55.620
Now let's export this out as well or go to a file export Export as.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.790
And let's call this

10:01.280 --> 10:05.200
Roug underscore in for normal map.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.650
And there we go.

10:07.070 --> 10:10.360
And let's go into unity and bring it in there.

10:10.580 --> 10:17.270
So I'll bring up a Finder window grab that normal map drag it in.

10:18.110 --> 10:27.110
And now if I select that rug and drag that normal map into the normal map slot of the rug material and

10:27.110 --> 10:31.880
of course choose fix now to tag it as a normal map.

10:31.880 --> 10:39.050
Now if we zoom in we should be able to see a little bit more of a texture to it a little bit more depth.

10:39.050 --> 10:41.840
Let's go ahead and run the game and see what we can see.

10:41.840 --> 10:48.800
So now if we come over here and take a look at it yeah we can see a little bit more texture to it.

10:48.800 --> 10:54.680
We can also adjust the intensity of the normal map by clicking and dragging here and increasing this.

10:54.680 --> 10:59.890
You can see we can really get some crazy texture going on there.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.420
I don't think we need quite that much.

11:01.420 --> 11:08.950
We can take it up to say three maybe and give that a try and I'll run the game again.

11:09.150 --> 11:10.260
And let's take a look.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.730
Yeah you can see a little bit more depth to it there.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.930
That's pretty good.

11:18.050 --> 11:26.120
If we wanted to do that for other textures as well say we wanted a little bit more depth and texture

11:26.120 --> 11:35.240
to our floor here where we can go back to our Photoshop file of the floor texture and we can generate

11:35.260 --> 11:36.560
a normal map from that.

11:36.560 --> 11:46.700
So in here in the walls floor folder I've got that wood floor here that's just that seamless texture

11:46.700 --> 11:47.650
there.

11:47.700 --> 11:52.390
So let's go take a look at creating a normal map from this.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.430
So here in Photoshop I've gone ahead and brought that up.

11:55.550 --> 12:01.410
I'm going to double click on this layer over here and change it to a layer from a background.

12:01.700 --> 12:06.220
And now I can take this layer and generate a normal map from this.

12:06.230 --> 12:16.100
So if I come up here to filter 3D generate normal map you can see it here I'll switch to say a cube.

12:16.390 --> 12:17.700
And that doesn't look too bad.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.980
However I think I'd like to invert it.

12:21.010 --> 12:26.380
I think that the parts or the seams between the board should be pushed in.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.660
So I'm going to click invert here.

12:29.100 --> 12:29.470
Yeah.

12:29.470 --> 12:34.440
So those seams should be pushed in a click OK.

12:34.530 --> 12:38.860
And there's our normal map and all exported out.

12:39.030 --> 12:45.480
And now if we select that object in our material we can take that floor normal map drag it into the

12:45.480 --> 12:49.400
normal slot and Click Fix.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.500
Now to tag it as a normal map.

12:52.520 --> 13:00.400
Now if we come down here and take a look at it we can see just a little bit you can see in here we're

13:00.400 --> 13:03.840
getting a little bit of texture to that a little bit of bump.

13:03.850 --> 13:11.590
Now it's already tiling itself just like the color map because we have the tiling at 10 here.

13:11.590 --> 13:19.090
So the normal map is following along with that tiling we can increase the normal map a bit if we want

13:19.420 --> 13:21.490
maybe a bit too much.

13:21.490 --> 13:25.970
Well let's bring it down to say to see how that works.

13:26.170 --> 13:33.330
And even maybe a bit too much as well but let's see let's run the game see how it looks.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.330
Yeah that may be a bit too much.

13:37.730 --> 13:41.490
So let's maybe take that back down to one again.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.830
I'll go ahead and put that at 1 and let's run the game one more time

13:49.500 --> 13:55.050
yeah so we're getting a little bit of bump there in the floor and that's good.

13:55.070 --> 13:57.630
That's that's what we want.

13:57.640 --> 14:06.520
So as we go and continue on with other objects in the scene we can create normal maps in Photoshop based

14:06.520 --> 14:12.100
off of our color maps and bring them in here to unity and apply them to our materials.
