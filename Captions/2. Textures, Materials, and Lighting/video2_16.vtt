WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:07.310
Now before I export this out export the U-V map out I'd like to try and get a sense of what is what.

00:07.350 --> 00:14.170
What parts of this U-V map coincide to which parts of the 3D model.

00:14.250 --> 00:21.020
So say if I choose this face right here I can see that there is that face on the U.V. map.

00:21.090 --> 00:24.790
So let me select everything over here in a 3D view.

00:25.140 --> 00:29.940
And then as I begin selecting things over here I can't really see it yet.

00:29.970 --> 00:35.550
In the 3-D view but if I come down here to this little guy right here this keep U.V. and it moÃ«t selection

00:35.640 --> 00:36.990
in the sink.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.510
I can turn that on.

00:38.720 --> 00:44.090
Now if I select say this face here we can see which one it is here.

00:44.190 --> 00:50.760
So I'm going to press the L key over this and instead of selecting by seam else liked by normal I guess

00:51.150 --> 00:58.140
so that'll select everything and I'll hover over these and press the L key as well just so we can get

00:58.140 --> 01:00.810
a sense of where they are.

01:00.900 --> 01:07.900
Now they're kind of mixed in there and it be nice if I can access them kind of as one unit.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.750
And there are a couple of ways to do this.

01:09.750 --> 01:17.850
Now I can spend some time here and rearrange the map manually to try and get these things together so

01:17.850 --> 01:25.350
that when I take them into Photoshop I can kind of deal with them all at once or when I could also do

01:25.710 --> 01:34.440
is export the U.V. map out in parts so I could export the U.V. map out with only these pieces and then

01:34.440 --> 01:40.500
I could export the U.V. map out with all the other pieces and then overlay them on top of each other

01:40.620 --> 01:41.760
in Photoshop.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.830
That way I could turn the layer off for one and on for the other.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.490
So let me show you what I mean here.

01:48.510 --> 01:52.080
If I come back down here and turn this back off.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.980
Now I've only got these here right.

01:54.980 --> 02:03.450
I've only got these U-V islands coinciding with just the kitchen counters so I can export this out on

02:03.450 --> 02:03.900
its own.

02:03.900 --> 02:10.230
So let's say I go to Uvas and export U-V lay out here.

02:10.540 --> 02:16.320
Got to my textures folder I go in and create a new folder here and we'll call this I'll just call it

02:16.320 --> 02:17.580
kitchen.

02:17.750 --> 02:26.380
I'll put everything in there all the textures for the kitchen in there I'll take this to 2048 because

02:26.380 --> 02:36.250
I want it to be a little bit bigger and I'll call this countertops UVA's like that.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.620
So I'll go ahead and export this out.

02:39.980 --> 02:48.110
Now what I can do is just invert the selection so I can come down here to select and inverse or control

02:48.150 --> 02:49.000
I.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.870
And now I've inverted the selection for everything else.

02:52.880 --> 02:59.300
One thing about it is this little guy that handle once we texture this just that one U-V we're going

02:59.300 --> 03:02.250
to duplicate it all the way around.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.180
But I think it could be a little bit bigger.

03:04.180 --> 03:12.960
Here let me zoom in and select this as an island I'm going to choose you the island selection and I'll

03:12.960 --> 03:13.580
click that.

03:13.590 --> 03:18.920
And I just think I'll move it down into here and scale it up just a little bit.

03:19.020 --> 03:24.540
So now that I've got all of this here I can export this out as well.

03:24.750 --> 03:32.690
Export U-V lay out put it in that kitchen folder and for this let's call this cabinets.

03:32.730 --> 03:33.390
There we go.

03:33.570 --> 03:38.900
Oh and I need to make sure these are the same size.

03:39.150 --> 03:44.030
2048 and export these out as well.

03:44.030 --> 03:51.030
All right so now let's go take a look at them in Photoshop here in Photoshop I'll open them up.

03:51.050 --> 03:59.520
I'll go to that kitchen folder select both of them and let's open those up so you can see I've got one

03:59.520 --> 04:05.220
U-V map for the countertops and one for the cabinets.

04:05.220 --> 04:11.340
What let's do is let's go ahead and select everything here with control or command a and we'll copy

04:11.340 --> 04:13.760
it and then we can come over here.

04:13.770 --> 04:16.380
And if I just paste it in it's going to be in the wrong place.

04:16.380 --> 04:24.300
What I need to do is come over here to edit paste special and use this paste in place or shift command

04:24.300 --> 04:31.200
the click that and that inserts the movies into the proper place on the map.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.700
So if I turn this off and on hopefully you can see that let me zoom in a little bit.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.090
It's kind of hard to see.

04:37.250 --> 04:43.840
So you can see here how they've been placed in the proper spot on the U-V map.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.700
So now I can work with each individual one.

04:46.700 --> 04:53.330
I can work with just the wood and the handle or I can work with just the countertops.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.250
So well let's do it.

04:54.270 --> 04:56.940
Let's go ahead and work with the wood for now.

04:57.060 --> 05:03.990
Most of these are going up and down I see the grain should be going up and down but up here you can

05:03.990 --> 05:08.180
see the grain is going horizontally these are the kitchen cabinets here.

05:08.550 --> 05:09.720
But let's see what we can do.

05:09.720 --> 05:16.890
I'm going to open up a new texture I'm going to go to my textures folder on my drive and I think I have

05:16.890 --> 05:19.890
a wood grain that I kind of like.

05:19.890 --> 05:22.260
Let me see it's this one here.

05:23.200 --> 05:23.820
Yeah.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.160
I think I'd like to use this one for the kitchen cabinets so I will open that up.

05:30.770 --> 05:31.760
Select it all.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.660
Copy it.

05:33.540 --> 05:37.850
And let's bring it into this document here.

05:37.860 --> 05:42.610
I will paste it drag it down beneath the movies.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.080
I better call these the cabinet movies so I know which one it is.

05:49.150 --> 05:52.290
And these are called these the counter movies.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.040
All right so this is a little bit big.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.690
Obviously we're going to need to shrink this down quite a bit.

05:57.700 --> 06:03.920
I'm going to go ahead and rotate it 90 degrees and shrink it down some.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.550
And let me see if I can place it right down here.

06:08.500 --> 06:16.690
See how this looks I'm wondering if this is going to be small enough for the counter's I think it will

06:16.690 --> 06:17.740
be.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.990
Let's go ahead and use this like this.

06:20.060 --> 06:28.680
I'll press shift and Allt and click and drag and let's start duplicating this around the U-V map here.

06:30.190 --> 06:37.130
All right I have gone through the same process that we've gone through before just copying and arranging

06:37.220 --> 06:43.610
the woodgrain over the U.V. map as best as I can but I'm going to need to take this back into blender

06:43.610 --> 06:49.270
just to see if I've got the woodgrain in the right direction for all of the U.V. islands.

06:49.580 --> 06:55.930
So I'm going to turn off the movies for the cabinets here and I'm not going to clean it up quite yet.

06:55.940 --> 07:01.190
I just want to see how I did here and before I export it I'm going to go ahead and save it.

07:01.190 --> 07:05.780
I'm going to save it as a PSP here and I'll just call it cabinets.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.230
I'll just call it cabinets here.

07:09.860 --> 07:14.900
And now I'm going to export it file export Export as

07:18.070 --> 07:25.490
and export this as a PNB and I'll put it in that kitchen folder as well.

07:25.540 --> 07:33.380
So I call this cabinets underscore see for color map and let's see how we did over here in Blender.

07:33.380 --> 07:40.530
I'll go ahead and create a new material for the cabinets here in the material panel I'll just click

07:40.530 --> 07:49.200
new and let's call this cabinets here in the note editor I will go ahead and bring in an image node.

07:49.250 --> 08:01.050
I can go to add texture image texture and I'll go ahead and bring in that texture map that we created.

08:01.050 --> 08:06.880
Here it is and I'll switch to texture viewport shading.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.720
Now let's tab back into object mode and let's take a look at this.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.620
Yeah we're going to have issues with the counter and that's OK.

08:14.700 --> 08:21.360
I'm not worried about that right now I just want to make sure that everything is looking OK and to me

08:22.200 --> 08:24.970
this part doesn't look very good.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.600
I feel like these up here aren't looking very good.

08:27.600 --> 08:35.760
So I've got several areas in which either the woodgrain is going the wrong way or it just isn't looking

08:35.760 --> 08:36.950
very good.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.560
So one of those is this right up here.

08:40.600 --> 08:46.470
So let me go to face mode select that and I can see that that's that area there.

08:46.470 --> 08:51.060
It looks like that needs to be turned as well as this one up here.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.180
That doesn't look too bad.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.820
But this one appears turned in the wrong direction.

08:55.860 --> 09:03.800
So I just need to go through and figure out on the U-V map which ones are turned in the wrong direction.

09:03.900 --> 09:08.790
This is turned in the wrong direction here but I don't really care because the stove is going to be

09:08.790 --> 09:09.480
there.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.890
So that's fine by me.

09:11.940 --> 09:18.090
So what I'll do is go through and work on that and just try and edit those to turn the textures for

09:18.090 --> 09:26.250
these individual U-V islands in the proper direction well I've gone back to photoshop and turned some

09:26.250 --> 09:33.140
of these woodgrain textures to match the model a little better so let me bring that back in and let's

09:33.150 --> 09:34.740
see how it looks.

09:36.080 --> 09:40.530
All right so that looks a little better we've got woodgrain going up and down here.

09:40.820 --> 09:45.420
We think that looks pretty good so good to go with that for now.

09:46.210 --> 09:52.120
And now let's take a look at working on those countertops in Photoshop here.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.650
Go ahead and clean this up.

09:54.730 --> 10:03.550
So if I select the UVA's here and go come over here to my magic wand tool and select outside of the

10:03.550 --> 10:11.180
movies I'm going to have to shift click in a couple of areas down here to get these as well.

10:12.050 --> 10:18.590
Looks like I have all of them now I think I'm going to go to select and modify and contract and contract

10:18.590 --> 10:26.810
that selection by two pixels and then I'll take all of this woodgrain Photoshop Lares and combine them

10:26.840 --> 10:34.110
all together with control or command E and now I'll just hit delete and clean that up.

10:34.130 --> 10:41.030
Now I can come over here to these U-V islands and I'll work on these in the same way.

10:41.330 --> 10:46.450
So let me hide these here and now we've got our countertops.

10:46.670 --> 10:51.940
I just need to find a good texture for the countertops and lay these in in the proper places.

10:52.130 --> 10:52.760
You know what.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.900
Why don't I use that texture we used earlier.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.690
See if I can find that.

10:58.910 --> 11:04.310
I think back in here in the textures folder here.

11:04.310 --> 11:08.900
Isn't that what we used on the coffee table and wouldn't that be.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.550
I think that would work out OK.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.640
Let's give that a try.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.330
I'll open it up and bring it in.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.300
And let's check it out.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.260
Yeah I think this would probably work.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.320
All right.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.770
I do plan to put a bit of grunge over it.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.930
So I think it'll work out.

11:26.980 --> 11:30.170
All right I put that texture over those islands.

11:30.310 --> 11:36.670
I can grab that cabinet layer that cabinet texture and drag that up above here.

11:37.150 --> 11:40.820
Turn it back on and turn off the movies.

11:40.960 --> 11:47.920
And now the countertop is just showing through the empty places where the wood is so let's go ahead

11:47.920 --> 11:50.260
and export this and give it a try.

11:51.940 --> 11:56.460
All right here in Blender I'll just get rid of that and reload that.

11:56.470 --> 12:00.450
Bring that cabinets underscores C back in and let's take a look.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.250
Yeah I think that'll work.

12:03.250 --> 12:11.110
Now I'm going to want a lot more grunge but I think that's going to work just fine.

12:11.110 --> 12:15.070
So let's go clean that color map up before I add some grunge.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.890
I'll just go back to Photoshop.

12:17.950 --> 12:19.210
I've already cleaned this up.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.050
Let's take all of this.

12:21.070 --> 12:30.720
All of these countertop layers and combine them down to one call this counter and I'll call these cabinets.

12:31.210 --> 12:38.650
I'll select the counters you the layer and with the magic wand to go ahead and select around all of

12:38.650 --> 12:44.020
those me turn off the wood here just to make sure I have all of these selected.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.270
Yep looks like that's good.

12:46.270 --> 12:47.840
I'll expand the selection.

12:47.860 --> 12:53.200
Scuse me can track the selection by two pixels over the counter layer.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.610
Delete and there we go.

12:55.610 --> 13:07.420
So now we've got that let's now create a new layer put it behind all of this make it black go to our

13:07.540 --> 13:11.310
paint bucket tool and let's put black behind there.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.200
All right.

13:12.580 --> 13:18.500
Now we think all we need to do is just work on bringing in some grunge just some dirt and nastiness.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.460
We'll work on that in the next video.
