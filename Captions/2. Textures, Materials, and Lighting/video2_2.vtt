00:00.530 --> 00:05.910
To test out our Virtex colors Let's go ahead and export this lamp out.

00:05.910 --> 00:12.200
I'm going to select both objects of the lamp and go to file and export and FBI x.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.210
I want to make sure and choose selected object.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.930
I don't want to export everything in the scene at this point in time at all.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.880
I'll just go ahead to my export folder here and I'll call this table lamp.

00:25.890 --> 00:26.570
All right.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.070
And let's export that out.

00:29.510 --> 00:37.100
Now let's go over to substance painter and take a look at how we can use those Virtex colors to delineate

00:37.100 --> 00:38.630
different materials.

00:38.630 --> 00:43.230
So over here in substance painter we can bring in that SBX.

00:43.240 --> 00:53.990
Now I'll go up to file new and for this I'm going to use this PBR metal rough template and let me show

00:53.990 --> 00:55.300
you in unity.

00:55.310 --> 01:01.690
If we go back to unity and take a look at this and just look at one of our materials.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.520
Let's open up this coffee table top material.

01:04.520 --> 01:07.910
We've got an el bedo which is the color channel.

01:07.910 --> 01:11.300
We've got a metallic and a smoothness.

01:11.300 --> 01:16.240
Now the metallic and the smoothness is the same thing as we go back to substance.

01:16.240 --> 01:24.190
Painter the metal and the rough so roughness is just the opposite of smoothness right.

01:24.230 --> 01:28.570
So are metal rough template here is going to work just fine in unity.

01:28.820 --> 01:32.210
I'll go ahead and click select to bring in my table lamp.

01:32.210 --> 01:39.170
Here it is and open and then OK.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.400
And there it is.

01:40.700 --> 01:48.020
So now you can see in much the same way that unity was able to take a look at the different objects

01:48.020 --> 01:55.190
in different materials of the model and split it out based on material that same thing is happening

01:55.190 --> 01:56.400
over here.

01:56.480 --> 02:04.090
So our texture set we have a texture set for the lamp base and a texture set for the lamp shade.

02:04.100 --> 02:11.770
Now the lamp base remember we use the Virtex paint tool to add different colors to the base.

02:11.930 --> 02:19.970
So to use those if we select the base over here and go to our texture set settings and click on bake

02:20.210 --> 02:27.620
textures we're going to bake texture maps out that are going to allow substance painter to apply its

02:27.620 --> 02:30.520
materials onto the different parts of the object.

02:30.620 --> 02:38.060
But in here we need to do one more thing we need to come in here to the ID section and instead of having

02:38.060 --> 02:43.830
its source be the material color we want it to be the vertex color.

02:44.390 --> 02:51.260
So now if we come down here and choose bake lamp base textures it will begin to generate the textures

02:51.290 --> 02:54.530
that substance painter needs.

02:54.530 --> 03:00.530
All right so here they are it's generated a normal map world space ambient occlusion all this.

03:00.530 --> 03:08.150
But you can see here it's generated in an ID or a color ID map that we can use to split out the different

03:08.150 --> 03:09.990
parts of the model.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.670
So let's see what we can do with this.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.530
I'm going to create groups or folders here.

03:15.710 --> 03:23.300
And each one of these folders or groups is going to allow me to pick a particular vertex color and everything

03:23.300 --> 03:27.470
within that group will only show through for that vertex color.

03:27.470 --> 03:37.300
So let's say this is the the lamp base bottom and we'll create another group for the main part I guess

03:38.390 --> 03:43.430
and we'll create another group for the top part and we go.

03:43.730 --> 03:52.010
So for the bottom let's right click on this choose add mask with color selection.

03:52.070 --> 03:52.910
Let's come over here.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.590
Choose pick color.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.290
And now we can see those vertex colors that we created in Blender.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.370
So I'll come over here and just click on the red part for the bottom can click on it here or over here

04:07.420 --> 04:14.970
and now whatever we put in this group is going to be constrained by this particular vertex color.

04:15.220 --> 04:20.500
So here I'm going to go ahead and create a couple of fill layers right here.

04:20.550 --> 04:27.600
One and Two and I need to drag these in to the group so I'll take them into here.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.390
And there they are.

04:30.440 --> 04:38.120
So let's say we want that bottom part to be kind of a brass color.

04:38.480 --> 04:44.680
Here's a brass I can use that so I've selected that fill layer and click on the brass and there it is.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.910
And notice that it's only showing through.

04:47.960 --> 04:56.150
Based on that red Virtex color that we selected I think I want some sort of dirt or something underneath

04:56.150 --> 05:00.210
that so maybe so maybe I'll choose this steel rough.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.930
Here let me choose this fill layer.

05:03.110 --> 05:10.430
Click on the steel ruff and now we need to allow that to show through so I'm going to right click on

05:10.550 --> 05:17.750
the first Lehre choose a black mask and for that black mask you can see it showing through there.

05:17.750 --> 05:24.790
I'm going to choose a generator and for that generator I'll choose a dirt mask here.

05:25.880 --> 05:26.840
So now you can see.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.250
Let me zoom in here.

05:29.020 --> 05:35.980
You've got that brass material with that steel rough material showing through.

05:35.980 --> 05:40.810
Now we can invert this over here and you can turn the invert on.

05:40.810 --> 05:41.950
See how that works.

05:41.940 --> 05:48.760
It doesn't look too bad and we can of course adjust all kinds of parameters over here the grunge amount

05:48.790 --> 05:50.830
the dirt level et cetera.

05:50.890 --> 05:53.440
But for now I think I'll just go with this.

05:53.470 --> 06:01.060
Let's do the next part let's say the next part we want to be that kind of whitish color that we saw

06:01.060 --> 06:03.130
in the reference image.

06:03.130 --> 06:08.060
So once again I'll come up here to that main group which is this part.

06:08.090 --> 06:13.170
All right click choose add mask with color and now pick a color.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.250
And this time I want to pick the blue right here.

06:17.250 --> 06:22.110
And in this group once again I want to add to fill layers.

06:22.260 --> 06:25.570
So I'll come up here add one and two.

06:26.130 --> 06:33.730
Drag them into the group right there they're and for this I want to choose maybe this plastic.

06:33.730 --> 06:37.390
That's a nice material for this war.

06:37.390 --> 06:38.320
That's shiny.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.420
Let's get that the proper color.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.420
Something like that maybe.

06:43.780 --> 06:48.870
And for this one here maybe I'll do a little bit of fine rust.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.230
Let's try that.

06:51.320 --> 07:00.050
OK so now I can take this one here and add a black mask so the bottom one shows through and then I'll

07:00.050 --> 07:04.190
add a generator to have it only show through.

07:04.190 --> 07:11.310
Based on this dirt mask here so I click that begins to show through let me click invert and see what

07:11.310 --> 07:12.380
happens.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.870
Yaseen I like that.

07:14.070 --> 07:14.630
OK.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.040
Good.

07:16.050 --> 07:19.350
The next one let's do one last one let's do the top.

07:19.350 --> 07:22.980
This one I think should be kind of a silver medal.

07:22.980 --> 07:28.970
So once again add to Phil Lares drag him in

07:31.900 --> 07:33.270
mask with color.

07:34.380 --> 07:47.180
Select that green and for this I want a steel rough and for this one that's going to show through maybe

07:47.180 --> 07:54.450
this rust course and then let's add our black mask.

07:56.430 --> 08:06.970
And our generator and select generator over here I think invert it and there we go.

08:07.160 --> 08:12.660
So now it's looking sufficiently dirty and kind of nasty.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.750
And there is the base of our lamp.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.320
Now of course there's more we can do here.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.920
There's lots of settings to adjust.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.370
But my point here was not to give a thorough tutorial on substance painter.

08:26.450 --> 08:34.190
My point is that once again there's yet another way to organize your objects and your materials for

08:34.190 --> 08:37.570
export out of Blendr in this way.

08:37.610 --> 08:47.150
We had one object one material and used our Virtex paint tool to break that one material up into individual

08:47.150 --> 08:56.000
areas that a program like substance painter or pixel studio will allow us to isolate and use almost

08:56.000 --> 08:58.610
as if it's its own material.

08:58.610 --> 08:59.030
All right.

08:59.030 --> 09:07.850
So let's go ahead and export out our texture maps for this texture set into unity and then in the next

09:07.850 --> 09:13.290
video we'll go ahead and import everything into unity and see how it looks.

09:13.370 --> 09:13.670
All right.

09:13.670 --> 09:23.650
So I'm going to go up here to file export textures and I want to choose a configuration.

09:23.650 --> 09:29.460
Here we've got a unity five standard metallic which is what we want.

09:29.460 --> 09:38.220
We're using that metal rough template and in here we've got a lamp shade and a lamp base we don't need

09:38.220 --> 09:39.110
the lamp shade.

09:39.110 --> 09:45.780
We didn't do anything with that and the lamp base we don't need 2048 we could probably take this down

09:45.780 --> 09:48.770
to say 5:12 Let's try that.

09:48.960 --> 09:55.500
And within here within this texture set you can see we've got the albedo which is the color channel

09:55.500 --> 09:59.680
we've got the combination metallic and smoothness here.

10:00.060 --> 10:05.780
And we've got the normal map and on a mission map that we're not going to be using.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.940
So I want to select where this is going to go.

10:09.210 --> 10:15.870
And for this I want to put it right in my Unity project right here.

10:17.160 --> 10:23.130
And I'll go into the assets folder go into textures and this time I'll create a brand new folder and

10:23.130 --> 10:31.830
just call this table lamp and in here I will drop all of these texture maps so I'll just click export

10:33.690 --> 10:34.600
and there they go.

10:35.830 --> 10:40.780
So coming up we'll go into unity and we'll plug them all in to the Unity material.
