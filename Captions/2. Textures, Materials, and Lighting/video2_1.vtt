WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:06.600
So let's work on another way of organizing and importing our objects and materials.

00:06.870 --> 00:13.230
This time we'll be thinking about using an external application like quick small studio or substance

00:13.230 --> 00:14.220
painter.

00:14.220 --> 00:21.990
And these are great applications that allow you to do PBR texturing or physical based rendering that

00:21.990 --> 00:27.820
allows you to create textures based on real world settings and lighting.

00:27.990 --> 00:35.880
So all of the processes that we've already looked at regarding grouping or creating materials exporting

00:35.880 --> 00:44.070
your object out to unity all of those things apply so we could export a single FDX with the multiple

00:44.070 --> 00:50.590
objects and a material for each object to say substance painter and work with it there.

00:50.640 --> 00:58.050
We could also export out a single object with multiple materials and substance painter would see those

00:58.140 --> 01:01.100
separate materials just the way unity does.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.180
And then you could work with those individual materials in texturing.

01:05.340 --> 01:13.110
But in addition you can also use something called Color ID or vertex colors so you can assign vertex

01:13.110 --> 01:19.680
colors to your object different colors for each material and then that external application like quick

01:19.680 --> 01:27.600
soul or substance painter is going to see that color ID those individual Virtex colors as individual

01:27.600 --> 01:28.820
materials.

01:28.830 --> 01:35.560
So in Blendr you give your object one material but then you apply different Virtex colors to it.

01:35.820 --> 01:40.120
And in substance painter it sees it as multiple materials.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.890
So let's give that a try.

01:41.940 --> 01:49.680
I've got substance painter here and this is what I'm going to use to bring that object that Blendr object

01:49.680 --> 01:54.440
with vertex colors in just to show you the difference.

01:54.450 --> 02:01.140
Now since the Blendr object is going to be all one material we're going to have all one U.V. map for

02:01.140 --> 02:02.010
it.

02:02.010 --> 02:06.480
What I'm going to do is create a lamp here this kind of teardrop lamp.

02:06.480 --> 02:12.810
And the object that we'll be bringing into substance painter is this base piece which I'm going to have

02:12.810 --> 02:19.110
the say porcelain here and maybe Brasstown down there and I'm going to use a substance painter to give

02:19.110 --> 02:22.270
it kind of worn rusted look.

02:22.560 --> 02:28.770
However this lampshade I'm going to have to use a different material at the very least it could be a

02:28.770 --> 02:36.360
wholly separate object so that when I take the whole thing as an FBI file into Blendr I can assign a

02:36.360 --> 02:44.490
specific material to the lampshade only and give it some emission so it looks like there's a light inside

02:44.610 --> 02:46.140
the lampshade.

02:46.140 --> 02:46.380
All right.

02:46.380 --> 02:50.430
So let's get to making this lamp here and see what we can do.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.640
So I'm going to go to a brand new layer.

02:53.860 --> 03:01.640
I'll go over to the Create tab and create a new cylinder and instead of 32 sizes take it down to 12.

03:01.880 --> 03:06.020
And I don't want to cap Phil on this so I'll just change that to nothing.

03:06.320 --> 03:15.470
Let's scale it in the z x and z scale that down a bit and I'll hit maybe three key and the five key

03:15.470 --> 03:22.490
and the period key to zoom in and go to an orthographic view and it looks to me like this bottom edge

03:22.490 --> 03:24.530
here flares out just a little bit.

03:24.530 --> 03:28.120
So scale that out some maybe like that.

03:28.220 --> 03:35.480
And now let's begin working on the lamp proper So this is the base here I'll hit E and then scale it

03:35.480 --> 03:41.410
in just a bit and then I'll begin extruding up so I'll hit E and Z and pull it up.

03:42.110 --> 03:44.190
And then I'll scale out of it.

03:44.540 --> 03:51.680
And let's begin working on that teardrop shape there I'll hit the end Z again and let's bring it up

03:51.680 --> 03:52.880
and scale it out.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.510
And maybe easy and we'll just keep working our way up here.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.930
Let's see doesn't need to go out some more.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.090
Can it begin to come in.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.150
How about something like that.

04:06.340 --> 04:07.220
Easy.

04:07.240 --> 04:12.910
And I can adjust these edge loops later as I need to.

04:13.120 --> 04:23.720
Once I get the basic shape in easy scale it in some easy and scale and then some.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.260
So we've got the basic shape there of the lamp.

04:27.260 --> 04:35.840
It looks like I could maybe take this guy with alt click and take him up some scale it in a bit.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.700
And I think I'll add just an edge right here and scale it out a bit there.

04:39.740 --> 04:46.850
So you get more of a flare out with that and go something like that.

04:48.170 --> 04:56.850
All right I'll go ahead and create a little cap so I'll just hit the and scale that out a smidge in

04:56.860 --> 05:02.820
easy and raise that up in the Z something like that and then close it off here

05:09.710 --> 05:12.830
doesn't need to be too elaborate up here.

05:13.310 --> 05:21.290
And to close that off I'll press Allt am to bring up the merge menu and I'll merge those selected vertices

05:21.290 --> 05:24.370
at the center and there we go.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.090
All right.

05:25.100 --> 05:30.690
So we've got that we can always come over here and smooth this.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.230
I'm going to go to the Tools tab and hit smooth.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.380
Well smooth that out a bit.

05:35.380 --> 05:39.580
So it isn't quite so blocky and down here.

05:39.580 --> 05:43.390
I could come in here and choose these faces right here.

05:43.400 --> 05:51.820
Allt click between two faces to choose that entire face loop and I could come to the shading Uvas tab

05:52.330 --> 05:55.120
and I'll flatten those out like that.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.580
Now that should give me a little bit more of an edge there at the bottom.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.500
Let's go ahead and create that lamp shade.

06:02.500 --> 06:11.910
Now all come back to perspective view for a minute with the five key and I'm going to create a new cylinder.

06:11.910 --> 06:15.880
Once again it's only got 12 signs that's good and no cap Phil..

06:16.010 --> 06:23.290
I'll go back to the orthographic view with three in the five key and let's bring this back up.

06:24.590 --> 06:34.860
And scale that a bit the zeem maybe it could be a little bit wider and then let's grab that edge up

06:34.860 --> 06:41.100
top here and scale that in a bit something like that.

06:41.330 --> 06:41.940
Yeah.

06:43.030 --> 06:48.670
Now when we take this into the game we're going to be able to see the inside of the lampshade and the

06:48.670 --> 06:51.700
back of any polygon we're going to be able to see through.

06:51.700 --> 06:57.180
So we're going to want to give this a little bit of fitness so we can't see through it.

06:57.700 --> 07:04.000
So to do that we can come over here to the modifiers panel and choose add modifier and we can use this

07:04.060 --> 07:06.630
solidify modifier.

07:06.750 --> 07:12.180
And if we choose that now I can grab this thicknesse field to click and drag on it and you can see I

07:12.180 --> 07:17.340
can make it thicker on the inside here or something like that.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.590
I think that will work.

07:19.650 --> 07:22.530
Now if I hit apply there we go.

07:22.530 --> 07:26.700
You can see that we've got a bit of thickness to that now.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.410
Now there's a little seam on the top and the bottom we could probably go ahead and just add a little

07:31.410 --> 07:37.080
bit of an edge up here and a little bit of an edge down here.

07:37.110 --> 07:45.300
I'm going to hit the and click and now I want to scale out but not in the z so I'll press S to scale

07:45.480 --> 07:49.620
shift Z to turn off the z axis and just scale out just a bit.

07:50.160 --> 07:59.810
I go same down here extrude and then S and shift Z and we go.

08:00.250 --> 08:00.670
All right.

08:00.670 --> 08:06.430
So now what I can do is go ahead and smooth this we go.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.750
So now we need to U-V map the whole thing.

08:09.790 --> 08:15.550
I think what I'll do is split it out by material or what's going to be a different material.

08:15.700 --> 08:24.340
So if we go back to the U-V editing screen layout frame it up with the period key and hit the tab key.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.860
Let's work on this part down here first.

08:27.910 --> 08:31.330
I think what I'll do is go ahead and put a seam right down here.

08:31.780 --> 08:36.670
Let's go to edge mode alt click and edge put a seam right down here.

08:38.110 --> 08:39.860
Let's put an image right back here.

08:39.940 --> 08:42.550
Let's just say that this will be the back of the lamp.

08:42.550 --> 08:47.110
So press control E and Mark see him again I'll hit the A key.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.970
Disliked everything you for the U-V mapping menu and click unwrap.

08:52.330 --> 08:57.310
Now notice that it's not looking quite the same as it does in a 3D view.

08:57.310 --> 09:01.990
And once again it's because we don't have the scale applied.

09:01.990 --> 09:09.370
So if I go back to the properties panel we can see that the scale is nonuniform.

09:09.500 --> 09:18.660
So I control a scale and then I'll go back to edit mode and hit you and unwrap.

09:18.670 --> 09:23.860
And now we see it's conforming to the shape and size of our object.

09:23.890 --> 09:29.140
A little bit better now it's pulling quite a bit up here which is pulling down here.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.330
I think what I'll do is go ahead and split it out.

09:31.330 --> 09:37.930
At this point up here I kind of put an extra edge up here so I'll split that out here just to give it

09:38.080 --> 09:41.090
a little bit of room to breathe.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.840
You and unwrap.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.600
There we go that's a little bit better we see there.

09:46.690 --> 09:49.730
Now if we wanted to check how are you.

09:49.740 --> 09:56.440
The map is going to look to see whether or not the textures are going to be stretched on this we can

09:56.440 --> 10:03.550
apply a U-V test pattern to it just to see if there's any stretching now over here under display.

10:03.550 --> 10:12.280
You can also turn on stretch display and anything that's blue is not stretched and anything that moves

10:12.280 --> 10:16.350
towards orange yellow or red is stretched.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.710
So it appears we're doing pretty well here.

10:18.880 --> 10:25.660
However if we wanted to really test it with a U-V test pattern we need to go ahead and apply our material

10:25.660 --> 10:27.160
here or create a material.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.460
I'll select new material panel.

10:29.710 --> 10:39.430
I'll call this lamp base and in our U-V image editor I'm going to come down here and click new and instead

10:39.430 --> 10:45.040
of a blank image that I'm creating here I'm going to choose U.V. grid and that will generate black and

10:45.040 --> 10:46.960
white texture pattern.

10:47.110 --> 10:49.210
I'll call this U-V test.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.360
And I'll click OK and there is our U-V test pattern.

10:55.760 --> 11:01.370
Now we can assign the test pattern texture to the lamp material.

11:01.370 --> 11:08.570
So I'll press shift a texture image texture and let's pull down this little menu right here and you

11:08.570 --> 11:10.340
can see it right in here.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.170
So now you can see here is our test pattern and it doesn't look great.

11:17.170 --> 11:21.170
Of course you can see that seem very clearly back there.

11:21.250 --> 11:26.620
But the good thing is as we can put that seam away from the camera away from the player so it won't

11:26.620 --> 11:27.790
be seen.

11:28.330 --> 11:33.410
Let's go back into our U-V map here.

11:33.790 --> 11:40.930
And I think what I'd like to do is just select this U-V Island and maybe rotate it a bit so it's more

11:41.050 --> 11:42.940
straight up and down here.

11:43.150 --> 11:46.180
And this one really doesn't matter much.

11:46.200 --> 11:51.300
That's going to be up inside the lamp and this one here.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.460
I think it looks OK.

11:54.130 --> 12:00.250
What we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating really procedurally generated materials that

12:00.250 --> 12:02.500
are then applied as textures.

12:02.650 --> 12:10.780
So we don't need it to be as clean and straight as we might if we were say applying text to an object

12:11.630 --> 12:20.970
to scale this up just a little bit to kind to maximize the screen space here or the resolution or something

12:20.970 --> 12:21.720
like that.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.970
All right let's U-V map the lampshade.

12:25.970 --> 12:30.540
Now if I select the lampshade let's just.

12:31.580 --> 12:35.390
Well it looks like we could split out the insides.

12:35.390 --> 12:38.250
I think let's do that.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.800
So a seam here and a seam down here.

12:43.450 --> 12:49.690
And then let's split it out in the same place that that other seam was right down here so alt click

12:49.690 --> 12:53.240
that seam and let's mark a seam there.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.760
Now take a look at how this looks.

12:56.230 --> 12:57.530
Yeah that's pretty good.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.120
I'll go with that.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.470
We can switch from conformal to angle based.

13:02.530 --> 13:09.970
That to me looks even a little better and we can apply a U.V. test pattern to this as well create the

13:09.970 --> 13:11.300
new material.

13:11.380 --> 13:20.440
Call it lamp shade and let's apply that U-V test pattern to this as well just to make sure we're doing

13:20.440 --> 13:26.500
all right not too bad I think it'll work just fine.

13:26.500 --> 13:32.680
Especially since these are just going to be kind of overall procedural type textures that don't have

13:32.680 --> 13:36.410
any text or specific patterns on them.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.830
So I think we'll be good with these.

13:38.830 --> 13:42.150
All right so now let's go back to our default view.

13:42.400 --> 13:48.070
And what I'd like to do now is a sign of Virtex colors to the parts of this object that are going to

13:48.070 --> 13:49.950
be separate materials.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.420
So we don't have a lot of different parts to this.

13:52.420 --> 13:58.420
Now this can be done for a much larger more complex piece but I just wanted to show you in terms of

13:58.420 --> 14:00.040
a very simple object.

14:00.040 --> 14:07.170
So let's go over to the object mode menu here and let's switch from object mode to vertex paint.

14:07.540 --> 14:12.280
And here we have the vertex paint tools over here on the left.

14:12.310 --> 14:19.330
If I come over and change to say a blue color and click and drag you can see I can create paint colors

14:19.480 --> 14:21.780
per vertex.

14:21.790 --> 14:28.500
Notice that it's painting just on individual vertices and that's that's what Virtex paint does.

14:28.540 --> 14:33.810
Now to make my life a little easier I could go through and paint this by hand like this.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.170
And we could get the job done.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.380
But that's a little tedious.

14:39.400 --> 14:45.460
So what I want to do is come down here to this little guy this face selection masking button and click

14:45.460 --> 14:46.540
that.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.830
Now we've got faces that we can select and de-select.

14:49.840 --> 14:57.610
Now I'm going to de-select that with the aiki and I can press the L key and select the object or the

14:57.610 --> 15:04.170
part of the object that has been delineated by the seam so I had a seam down here and I had a seam up

15:04.190 --> 15:08.200
here and so it selected everything between the seams.

15:08.620 --> 15:15.100
So now with all of these faces selected I can press shift K and that will fill that whole area with

15:15.100 --> 15:20.980
that particular color if I need to come back to that color I can create a new palette and come down

15:20.980 --> 15:25.090
here and click new and then add this blue to my palette.

15:25.120 --> 15:25.830
So there it is.

15:25.830 --> 15:32.440
I can always come back to it now the next one down here let's fill with a different color let's say

15:34.210 --> 15:42.190
red I'll hit a de-select I'll hover over this area and press the key and that will select all of those

15:42.190 --> 15:47.440
faces and our press shift K and that will fill that area up with that color.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.350
Let's go ahead and capture that color in case we need to use it again.

15:51.370 --> 15:52.390
And what about up here.

15:52.390 --> 15:57.310
Let's do this one too maybe this is a different kind of metal than the one on the base.

15:57.310 --> 16:01.230
Maybe this is a silver or a stainless steel thing.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.770
I don't know.

16:03.200 --> 16:12.190
I'm going to hit the L key and let's give this one a green color like here a press shift K and I'll

16:12.190 --> 16:15.760
also save that just in case I want to use it again.

16:15.760 --> 16:21.060
So there we have the vertex colors assigned to our object.

16:21.100 --> 16:30.160
So now these vertex colors can be seen by a program like substance painter and it will assume that your

16:30.160 --> 16:34.290
different colors are what you want to be different materials.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.170
So let's go back to object mode here.

16:37.210 --> 16:42.010
We're going to go ahead and make sure I've got everything named properly.

16:42.010 --> 16:43.480
Let me look at my materials.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.160
I've got lint base for that and lamp shade for that.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.750
Good do I have that in the object as well.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.650
No I don't.

16:50.860 --> 16:55.310
So let me copy the material and put it in the name of the object.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.690
And let's go to the lambastes.

16:57.730 --> 17:02.050
Same thing here let me copy the material name and put it in the name of the object.

17:02.530 --> 17:03.940
Excellent.

17:03.940 --> 17:12.650
Now we have our lamp and we make sure that we are here with uniform scale.

17:12.650 --> 17:18.760
We don't have that for the lampshade Let's go ahead and hit control a in scale.

17:19.280 --> 17:28.470
Let's put the center or the pivot point of the lampshade at the base of the lamp set origin the 3D cursor.

17:28.490 --> 17:31.370
Let's make sure that's done for this as well.

17:31.370 --> 17:33.520
Set origin to 3D cursor.

17:33.560 --> 17:38.640
That can just help us snap objects easier once we get it into unity.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.400
Because the pivot point from Blendr is going to be the pivot point in unity.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.660
All right let's bring everything else back.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.580
Holy smokes.

17:46.580 --> 17:50.720
Look at that and let's scale these down.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.240
Just select the lampshade and scale them down.

17:55.250 --> 17:59.300
So we're going to have to reapply our scale here aren't we.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.670
I forgot about that.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.990
Let's put this up on the table.

18:04.480 --> 18:09.420
Frame it up with the period key and let's see if we can get it.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.290
So it looks about right.

18:14.290 --> 18:18.660
So the scale of the object is OK.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.420
What do you think is that.

18:20.430 --> 18:23.840
Feels a little big maybe else bring it down just a little bit.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.890
Something like that.

18:26.970 --> 18:33.080
All right so now let's go ahead and apply a scale of both of these objects control a scale.

18:33.090 --> 18:34.000
Good.

18:34.560 --> 18:39.190
Let's now go ahead and import these objects now.

18:39.190 --> 18:44.070
I haven't imported yet the end table here.

18:44.070 --> 18:49.440
I just kind of created this table based on the coffee table.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.960
So I haven't imported that yet either.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.780
Let me make sure that the name is good in table.

18:56.780 --> 19:03.640
I'm using the same materials for the table and I'll use the same texture to at least for now.

19:03.710 --> 19:10.380
But let's take this object right here as an FBI acts into substance painter.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.180
And see what it makes of it.
