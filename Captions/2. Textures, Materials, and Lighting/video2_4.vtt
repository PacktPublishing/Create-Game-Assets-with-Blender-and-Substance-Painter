00:00.510 --> 00:06.360
So let's talk about a couple of issues with the way I've set up the U-V map currently.

00:06.390 --> 00:13.590
If you notice this wall back here is maybe a little more than half the size of this wall here with the

00:13.590 --> 00:19.020
windows but notice it's taking up the same amount of space on the map.

00:19.020 --> 00:26.190
Same with this door it's a different size than these other two walls but it's also taking up the same

00:26.550 --> 00:28.690
width at least on the map.

00:28.860 --> 00:35.430
So it doesn't look like our texture if we lay it down and tile it in Photoshop it doesn't look like

00:35.430 --> 00:38.740
it's going to be the same size on all of the walls.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.050
But let's test that.

00:40.050 --> 00:46.950
Let's bring in U-V test pattern here into our node Ed..

00:47.010 --> 00:55.530
But I think instead of using this wall living material Let's use our own material our own U-V test pattern.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.560
Do we have one set up yet.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.400
I don't think we do.

00:59.400 --> 01:04.670
Let's go ahead and create a new material for our U-V test pattern.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.950
Click the plus arrow here.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.080
We'll call this U-V test.

01:10.770 --> 01:15.040
And we'll assign that U.V. test node to it as well.

01:15.090 --> 01:20.010
So a press shift a texture image texture.

01:20.100 --> 01:26.940
And let's go ahead and select this U-V test pattern that we created some time ago and we can connect

01:26.940 --> 01:28.800
it up here in the node Ed..

01:28.800 --> 01:34.650
Now we can see it over here because we have texture viewport shading selected.

01:34.650 --> 01:40.040
Now we've got a lot of other materials on our objects here.

01:40.170 --> 01:47.280
For now I'm just going to remove all of these and that will allow us to see it on all of the walls.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.700
Since that's our only material.

01:49.740 --> 01:55.440
Now let's take a look at this the squares for these two walls.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.510
Don't look too bad.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.910
They look almost the same size.

01:59.250 --> 02:04.960
But if we come over here you can see that the squares for this wall here look quite a bit bigger.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.490
And that's going to be a problem when we lay down our texture.

02:08.490 --> 02:16.900
So if I tap back into edit mode here these squares are bigger because this U-V map is smaller.

02:16.920 --> 02:24.930
So if I just select the map here and hit s and scaled it up some see I can scale it up and tell the

02:24.930 --> 02:27.290
squares are about the same size.

02:27.330 --> 02:35.190
So the problem is that for our textures to be proportional and lay down on the object in the same way

02:35.190 --> 02:41.250
our U.V. maps are going to have to be proportional to the size of the object in the room here.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.830
So how do we do that.

02:42.840 --> 02:49.620
Well we can use that average Island scale tool again just like we did with the couch.

02:49.620 --> 02:57.030
So if I hit say the Beaky and border select all of these objects right in here now I'm not going to

02:57.030 --> 03:01.710
worry about the backs of the walls here see they're still down here.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.930
Very small.

03:02.940 --> 03:06.170
I'm not going to worry about those because we're not going to see those.

03:06.180 --> 03:12.720
So now that I have these selected I can press control a remember down here into the movies menu you've

03:12.720 --> 03:18.140
got average Island scale here that are control a small hit control a.

03:18.240 --> 03:26.360
And now it really scales each individual U-V islands so that they're all proportional to the objects

03:26.400 --> 03:35.340
in the room which allows us to have the texture be all one size or the checker patterns now are all

03:35.340 --> 03:36.660
the same size.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.000
And that's what we want.

03:38.340 --> 03:41.190
So now what I can do is pack all these in.

03:41.190 --> 03:46.310
Let me get these out of the way for just a moment here.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.180
Reast select all of these with the Beaky.

03:49.350 --> 03:54.290
And now I can pack them in pressing control P and then we go.

03:54.570 --> 03:56.640
Now I'd like to rotate them.

03:56.660 --> 04:00.420
I'll click this rotate here and there we go.

04:00.420 --> 04:08.370
Now they're all packed and I can then take these guys and bring them back up put them up here somewhere

04:08.640 --> 04:10.130
out of the way.

04:10.130 --> 04:17.510
Now we're using a little bit more of the texture space here in our 0 to 1 space than we were before

04:17.520 --> 04:21.840
with each individual object having its own unique U.V. map.

04:21.840 --> 04:26.800
So now we can export this out to Photoshop.

04:26.810 --> 04:29.310
Now here's a question for you.

04:29.970 --> 04:36.980
Now that we've done this will we have to re-import these walls in unity.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.860
We haven't really really mapped them.

04:39.860 --> 04:43.390
We've just rearranged the islands within the movie map.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.040
Is that going to be a problem.

04:45.440 --> 04:53.530
Well yes we are going to need to re-import the walls now that we've changed the U-V map.

04:53.530 --> 05:00.050
Anytime you change the U.V. map in any way whatsoever you need to get that object back over into unity

05:00.500 --> 05:05.080
the U.V. map is embedded in with the object.

05:05.540 --> 05:11.900
All right so now that we've exported that U.V. map what we can do is we can split these apart again

05:12.050 --> 05:14.680
now into their individual objects.

05:14.780 --> 05:20.300
So I have them selected and I can tap into edit mode and with all of these selected I can press the

05:20.300 --> 05:25.190
P key and separate the walls out by loose parts.

05:25.190 --> 05:33.350
Now they're all individual walls again and I can apply their individual materials back to them again.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.590
So this is Wall living room back right.

05:36.800 --> 05:44.570
So I can come in here and Wall living back and you can assign that created new materials slot and I

05:44.570 --> 05:50.530
can assign that baseboard living back so I can get those back on there.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.980
I can do the same thing over here.

05:51.980 --> 06:02.420
This was wall living room left so I can assign wall living left and with a new material slot here a

06:02.420 --> 06:13.170
sign that baseboard living left and with this wall I can assign this the wall windows and with the new

06:13.170 --> 06:17.250
material slot assign it baseboard windows.

06:17.370 --> 06:18.590
And then we go.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.500
So now all their original materials are back on them.

06:22.530 --> 06:29.490
Let's now go to photoshop and take a look at how we might texture these walls here in Photoshop or go

06:29.490 --> 06:35.420
to File Open find to that wall U-V map right in here.

06:37.350 --> 06:42.540
I'll call this Uvas and let's find a texture that we want to use.

06:42.540 --> 06:47.820
I've got this paper texture here that looks kind of nice.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.780
I think I'm going to try and work with this.

06:50.790 --> 06:55.280
It isn't seamless but I think I can maybe make it work.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.630
Let's give it a try.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.560
So I'm going to click open here and open that.

07:00.570 --> 07:01.680
And there we go.

07:01.950 --> 07:10.350
I think if I hit the M key and use Marcie's select here in Photoshop and just select everything up to

07:10.740 --> 07:16.850
there looks like I'm still getting some of these rivets on top.

07:16.850 --> 07:25.170
I don't want that so I will go to my select menu use transform selection and I'll pull this transform.

07:25.340 --> 07:28.220
This selection edge down like this.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.610
And we go.

07:30.820 --> 07:35.400
I'll hit enter and then I'll press control or command C to copy.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.270
And let's take it back over here.

07:37.270 --> 07:48.970
Now I'll paste the key for the move tool or press command 0 to zoom out or drag this below the movies

07:49.000 --> 07:54.240
so I can see the Hughie's there and I'll collapse this down like this.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.800
And let's see if we can do here.

07:57.330 --> 07:58.430
Zoom in a bit.

08:00.010 --> 08:05.350
And for this maybe I can just use it as is like this.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.300
Yeah let's give this a try.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.710
I'm going to select this part right here.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.880
Get this out of here so like just this right here.

08:16.970 --> 08:19.920
There and hit the delete key.

08:20.120 --> 08:28.130
And then I will select the move tool press alt and shift and I'll move this up and then I'm going to

08:28.220 --> 08:30.170
spin it all the way around.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.980
So this faded pieces over here on the corner.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.120
Let's give this a try.

08:35.120 --> 08:41.690
I'm going to press shift and click over here on the corner and spin this around like that I'm going

08:41.690 --> 08:52.000
to drag it down and kind of put it right against their Maybe something like this and I'll also drop

08:52.000 --> 08:55.210
that underneath that first one.

08:55.210 --> 08:57.320
So we have a clean edge there.

08:57.670 --> 09:06.080
And now we need to cut it out for the baseboard something hit the MP and make sure that layer is selected

09:06.110 --> 09:13.190
and then I'm going to drag a marquee to their and delete that.

09:13.210 --> 09:16.370
So now we have the baseboards we need to deal with.

09:16.750 --> 09:22.240
And we just need some sort of wood grain I think for that material.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.540
Let me see what I have.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.120
Let's take a look at these.

09:26.130 --> 09:31.800
I've got that wood grain that we looked at earlier that I used on the coffee table.

09:31.810 --> 09:39.350
But these want something a little darker maybe that that might not be bad.

09:39.640 --> 09:44.470
Let's try this let's try and use some of this although we're going to have to duplicate it quite a few

09:44.470 --> 09:46.580
times to get it to work.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.070
I kind of like it though.

09:49.090 --> 09:49.470
All right.

09:49.510 --> 09:51.130
Let's give it a try why not.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.530
So I will select all of that and copy it.

09:55.730 --> 10:04.790
Bring it over here and let's paste that into their hit the V key.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.840
And let's scale it down a bit.

10:09.190 --> 10:12.280
Now how big do we want this to be.

10:13.820 --> 10:19.760
We could take it like this and duplicated a few times and see if that works although we may get some

10:19.760 --> 10:24.990
repeating maybe something like this.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.110
Let's try that.

10:26.990 --> 10:27.670
Yeah.

10:27.950 --> 10:37.330
I'm going to press alt and shift and let's snap these over and hit the arrow key snap this hit the arrow

10:37.330 --> 10:44.410
key and just tile this over for the rest of the baseboard here.

10:48.380 --> 10:52.910
And one more.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.200
All right.

10:54.450 --> 10:57.360
Let's see how that looks.

10:58.260 --> 11:01.320
Let's give it a test before I clean it up.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.110
Let's give it a test and see.

11:03.150 --> 11:05.070
I'll turn off the movies.

11:05.220 --> 11:15.030
Go to file export and export as well export it as a PMG And let's give it a try.

11:16.890 --> 11:24.250
I'll change this to a C right here for a color map and export.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.470
Now if we go back into blender.

11:26.660 --> 11:34.130
So for the wall windows here I'm going to bring in an image texture and open that up.

11:35.590 --> 11:39.990
Go to my textures walls and wallpaper color.

11:40.010 --> 11:41.530
Let's see how that looks.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.480
It sufficiently gross.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.210
Kind of like it.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.460
Now notice what's happening with the window frames.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.770
Why is that happening.

11:54.980 --> 12:01.500
Well it's happening because we have the same materials on the window frames as we do on the wall.

12:01.730 --> 12:10.110
If we actually get rid of these and give it a new material for it's and call it may be window frame

12:12.450 --> 12:14.370
that gets rid of that.

12:14.580 --> 12:22.920
Now we can assign that same material to these other windows by choosing the window frames and then selecting

12:22.920 --> 12:27.970
this one last click that and then press control.

12:27.990 --> 12:34.080
L And now we can make the material the same as the last one we selected.

12:34.260 --> 12:40.170
So I'll choose material and that adds that material to all of those as well.

12:40.170 --> 12:47.160
All right so what we'll do is we'll work on assigning these to the other walls and in the next video

12:47.160 --> 12:49.770
we'll take it all into unity and see how it looks.
