WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:07.530
Well since the last video I've gone ahead and added a few things here I've added a ceiling and I have

00:07.980 --> 00:09.490
added a texture to it.

00:09.510 --> 00:15.870
I took the U-V map into Photoshop and layered a couple of different textures on top of each other to

00:15.870 --> 00:19.470
kind of get this dirty old ceiling kind of a look.

00:19.530 --> 00:27.450
I've also added a seamless texture to the floor and went ahead and added some texture to the doors.

00:27.450 --> 00:32.370
Now the doors I went ahead and did like I did the walls here.

00:32.400 --> 00:41.010
In other words I took two of these a door and a window frame combine them together arrange the U-V maps

00:41.010 --> 00:44.340
of the U-V islands were all on the same U-V map.

00:44.340 --> 00:52.470
And then I went ahead and textured that one U-V map to provide textures for both the window frames and

00:52.500 --> 00:53.220
the door jamb.

00:53.220 --> 01:00.060
So if we come over here to the U-V editing screen lay out and I will frame these up with the period

01:00.060 --> 01:02.080
key here.

01:02.340 --> 01:09.120
If I tab into Edit Mode save for the door frame you can see that here is the U-V map for that.

01:09.240 --> 01:17.310
And if I tab into the U.V. map for a window frame you can see that that's where the U-V islands are

01:17.310 --> 01:25.530
so they've been arranged once again into all one U-V map so that now even though these are different

01:25.620 --> 01:34.080
objects in the scene and in unity they still are only pulling from one that U-V map one texture map.

01:34.080 --> 01:42.300
So if we come over here to unity and I select one of these guys here I'll zoom into it with the F key.

01:45.620 --> 01:50.780
And so you can see the window frame texture here.

01:50.810 --> 01:51.810
There it is here.

01:51.830 --> 01:54.950
And it go ahead and expand that.

01:55.160 --> 02:03.290
So you can see that we've got both the window frame and the door jamb U-V maps all being represented

02:03.320 --> 02:05.630
on one texture map.

02:05.630 --> 02:09.610
Now I've also worked on the kitchen walls over here.

02:09.680 --> 02:17.960
This center wall and the walls here in the kitchen there will be kitchen counters and other things going

02:17.960 --> 02:22.930
on here on along the wall so we won't see a whole lot of the walls over here.

02:23.270 --> 02:32.330
But I went ahead and did the same thing yet again for these walls and combined the U-V islands all on

02:32.330 --> 02:39.080
to one U.V. map to make the texturing a little more efficient.

02:39.080 --> 02:39.740
All right.

02:39.830 --> 02:46.460
So all of these processes all of these techniques are things that we've already gone over in previous

02:46.550 --> 02:47.340
videos.

02:47.420 --> 02:50.510
So I didn't do anything new here per se.

02:50.510 --> 02:56.570
Now I've still got my HDR image in here for the reflections.

02:56.570 --> 03:01.030
You can see in there the reflections of that HDR image.

03:01.580 --> 03:09.920
But one thing I need to do here is turn off anti-aliasing and when using an HDR image currently in unity

03:10.310 --> 03:16.070
you do need to turn off the anti-aliasing and then re add it as an effect on the camera.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.600
So let's just take a look at that.

03:17.630 --> 03:18.890
Real quick.

03:19.050 --> 03:27.980
I'll come over here to the Edit menu and come over to project settings and quality and overhear under

03:27.990 --> 03:29.000
anti aliasing.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.480
I'm going to go ahead and turn this off to disabled.

03:32.480 --> 03:38.040
Now when I run the game I'm not sure that you'll be able to see this but now we have no anti-aliasing.

03:38.050 --> 03:44.420
And if you look real close along the edges of the objects you can see a kind of jagged goodness along

03:44.420 --> 03:45.480
the edge.

03:45.530 --> 03:46.240
I can see it here.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.490
I don't know if you'll be able to see it or not but it's certainly visible when you play the game.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.750
So we don't want that.

03:53.760 --> 04:00.330
So what we can do is add an anti-aliasing effect on the camera itself.

04:00.480 --> 04:07.890
But what we need to do is import those effects into the standard assets folder here.

04:07.890 --> 04:14.310
So to do that I'm going to right click in the assets folder and choose import package and you can't

04:14.310 --> 04:17.000
really see it here let me come up.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.910
We bring this up a little higher.

04:18.970 --> 04:28.990
I'm going to write click here and choose import package and here you can see effects click that it's

04:28.990 --> 04:35.180
going to think a while and you can see appear here under image effects you've got anti-aliasing here.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.780
So this is what we want.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.370
I'll go ahead and click Import

04:41.640 --> 04:48.350
and now we should have within our standard assets we should have this affects folder.

04:48.630 --> 04:56.870
And in here under image effects we should have scripts and here's our anti-aliasing script right here.

04:56.880 --> 05:05.070
So now if we come up to player and select that main camera we can click and drag that right over here

05:05.400 --> 05:06.960
into the inspector.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.030
Now there isn't a whole lot we need to do with this.

05:09.030 --> 05:13.670
It should be ok the way it is currently so I'll just hit play and let's take a look at it.

05:14.650 --> 05:19.420
And now if we go into these edges they're a little cleaner I don't know if you can see that or not but

05:19.420 --> 05:24.450
these edges along the coffee table are quite a bit cleaner than they were.

05:24.460 --> 05:31.390
The next thing I want to do is get the lighting in the room a little bit better a little bit more like

05:31.390 --> 05:33.660
we want to in the final scene.

05:33.700 --> 05:38.320
Currently we've got this kind of wash of ambient light in the scene.

05:38.320 --> 05:44.760
We're not able to distinguish pools of light and dark and the scene is just kind of a wash.

05:44.980 --> 05:51.910
So to change that I'm going to come over here to the lighting tab right up here and click on that and

05:52.000 --> 05:58.510
for the ambient intensity it's currently at one it's getting it's ambient intensity from the skybox

05:58.540 --> 06:00.700
from that HDR image here.

06:00.730 --> 06:06.790
So I want to just bring that down a bit make it a little bit darker in the room maybe bring that down

06:06.790 --> 06:09.570
to say let's put it at point two.

06:09.760 --> 06:16.720
Now we can also bring down the refl. intensity just a little bit and that will bring down the level

06:16.720 --> 06:17.470
of the scene as well.

06:17.470 --> 06:22.900
But I want that at least some of that reflection in there so maybe I'll take that down to like point

06:23.020 --> 06:32.650
eight and now we can see that we've got a little bit more ability to have these pools of light and dark.

06:32.650 --> 06:41.890
So for the point light here now I can go back to the inspector and maybe increase the intensity just

06:41.890 --> 06:44.210
a little bit like that.

06:44.290 --> 06:52.300
Right so we've got a little bit more of a differentiation between light and dark maybe even on this

06:52.510 --> 06:54.220
table lamp shade.

06:54.250 --> 07:02.020
I could increase the emission just a bit if I click and drag here I can maybe increase the emission

07:02.020 --> 07:06.430
just a bit so it looks a little bit more like there's light coming out of that.

07:06.490 --> 07:13.410
In addition what I can do is set up a couple of spotlights to point up and down out of the lampshade

07:13.420 --> 07:20.220
to give it the impression that the light is on and illuminating the area around the lamp.

07:20.230 --> 07:22.180
So let's try that.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.840
I will come over here to the hierarchy.

07:25.840 --> 07:30.920
Right click and I'll choose light and spotlight.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.040
Get this in place.

07:32.050 --> 07:36.950
I want to get this in place right inside that lamp there.

07:36.970 --> 07:47.540
Let me switch from shaded to wireframe and over here I'll tumble and select that y axis right there

07:48.170 --> 07:51.890
and switch from perspective to orthographic.

07:51.890 --> 07:58.750
And now I can move that light the center of that light right in the center of the lamp right there.

07:58.760 --> 08:07.550
All right I'll switch back from orthographic to perspective and I'll switch back to shaded.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.910
Now let's take a look at that.

08:08.930 --> 08:18.530
OK so I'll move this up into here and I'll expand the circle out a bit with this spot angle I can click

08:18.530 --> 08:21.600
and drag that out some like that.

08:21.610 --> 08:29.630
Let's say I can also turn on shadows I'll turn on the hard shadows there so you can kind of get a sense

08:29.630 --> 08:33.160
of how it's bleeding out there.

08:33.390 --> 08:37.800
Kind of like this with that more soft edge.

08:37.800 --> 08:38.840
They're coming now.

08:38.850 --> 08:42.030
And I like those shadows coming off of there.

08:42.060 --> 08:43.100
That's nice.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.570
And let's see what else we could do.

08:45.570 --> 08:49.710
Let's go ahead and duplicate this and turn it upward.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.850
This probably doesn't need to be quite so bright.

08:51.870 --> 08:56.090
Let me before I do that I mean take this down a bit like that.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.100
And let's also change the color some.

08:59.100 --> 09:07.530
This is an incandescent interior bulb so it's going to be more orangey so I'll maybe change the color

09:07.530 --> 09:13.230
just a little bit and a little bit of color can go a long way so you don't need to like crank it way

09:13.230 --> 09:19.670
over here that looks too much so just a little bit of color on a light goes a long way.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.580
And then we go to that.

09:22.590 --> 09:27.630
All right so now I'm going to duplicate this self-selected over here in press control or command D.

09:27.900 --> 09:34.950
And now I want to flip it over or I'll hit the e key to go to rotate and I'll click and drag around

09:35.790 --> 09:39.940
that x axis and I'll go ahead and put it.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.950
Negative 90 every go that turns it up.

09:45.050 --> 09:50.290
And let's see if we can get this in place down a bit.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.590
A little bit too much like that.

09:53.590 --> 10:02.250
Let me pull it up some and then pull the angle make it a little bit bigger spot angle right here and

10:02.400 --> 10:09.550
out a bit like that bring down some.

10:09.600 --> 10:15.990
So we get kind of this sense that that's a light source in the room.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.240
So let me select this one.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.570
I want to increase the spot angle just a little bit more here and then I want to bring it down.

10:23.580 --> 10:26.570
So there we go at something like that.

10:26.970 --> 10:36.990
OK so now let's say this one is what you want to call this we want to call this lamp down.

10:37.170 --> 10:46.140
And the other one is lamp up and that up there we go and this light here is going to be that bear ball

10:46.200 --> 10:53.430
once we model that and hang this in the scene it will be a bear bulb light so I'll just call that bear

10:53.760 --> 10:54.620
bulb.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.160
Light.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.370
There we go.

10:58.710 --> 11:04.270
I'll drag this down here and let's begin grouping these objects together.

11:04.270 --> 11:07.810
Now just to clean up the hierarchy a bit.

11:07.990 --> 11:14.350
Now down here in the assets fold or we can right click and create a new folder.

11:14.470 --> 11:21.790
But up here in the hierarchy there is no folder option here in the hierarchy what we need to do is create

11:21.790 --> 11:28.870
an empty and an empty as just a location without any geometry is just an empty object.

11:28.990 --> 11:35.560
So I'm going to create an empty and it automatically puts it over here in the center of my viewport.

11:35.560 --> 11:41.590
But what I want it to be is in the center of the scene so I'm just going to type 0 0 0 for the x y and

11:41.590 --> 11:49.490
z over here in the position and I'll change the name of this to the lights.

11:49.490 --> 11:57.040
Now we go now I can take these lights in the scene and drag them into that empty game object and what

11:57.040 --> 12:01.680
that does is it pretty much creates a type of folder right.

12:01.690 --> 12:06.450
That we can use to organize our scene up here.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.530
I've got a table lamp.

12:07.540 --> 12:12.080
I've got couch I've got player in table all of these here.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.710
I could create a group called furniture.

12:14.710 --> 12:15.680
Why don't I do that.

12:15.700 --> 12:26.780
I'll create an empty I'll put it in the center of the grid 0 0 0 I'll call this furniture and I'll drag

12:26.780 --> 12:33.440
the couch coffee table in table table lamp into that group.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
There we go.

12:35.310 --> 12:39.020
So now we have a group for our furniture.

12:39.660 --> 12:42.840
We've also got a group here with walls.

12:42.840 --> 12:51.820
I can also put that floor in that group as well I just call it walls ceiling floor I guess I can do

12:51.820 --> 12:53.020
that.

12:53.020 --> 12:56.290
Walls ceiling floor.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.440
And here we go.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.630
Clean that up a bit.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.690
So now we've got the hierarchy cleaned up.

13:01.690 --> 13:06.250
We have a pretty good clean assets folder down here that's good too.

13:06.250 --> 13:13.540
One thing I don't like is these big gizmos in my viewport the camera and the lights.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.600
I want to see them sometimes but not all the time.

13:16.750 --> 13:23.050
So I can come up here to the gizmos and for the 3-D icons you can turn these off and it will make them

13:23.050 --> 13:29.130
small or you can drag the slider all the way down and it will just take them all the way out of this

13:29.130 --> 13:29.960
scene.

13:30.220 --> 13:34.500
So now you can have a scene without all that clutter.

13:34.870 --> 13:39.700
Now I do think it may be a little bit too dark I'm going to bring the ambient intensity back up just

13:39.730 --> 13:43.870
a little bit so we can see what's going on in the room here as we work.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.510
Put that at point 7:5 as well.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.980
There we go.

13:47.980 --> 13:48.250
All right.

13:48.250 --> 13:55.360
So we've gone a long way to organizing our scene and setting up some of the lighting so we can see how

13:55.360 --> 13:58.030
things are going to look as we bring them in.

13:58.030 --> 14:01.940
Another thing we can do is add a color correction effect on our camera.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.510
See how that helps.

14:03.690 --> 14:04.460
Let's come over here.

14:04.480 --> 14:15.670
Back to the camera and I'll go into the standard assets effects image effects and scripts.

14:15.810 --> 14:20.300
Let's come over here to one of these color corrections let me drag this slider right here so we can

14:20.300 --> 14:22.760
see the full names.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.160
We've got curves.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.530
Look up and ramp Let's try curves.

14:27.530 --> 14:33.450
I'm just going to select this camera come over here to the inspector.

14:33.520 --> 14:39.820
So let me drag in this color correction curves here and click and drag right over here into the inspector

14:39.910 --> 14:43.050
and it doesn't look like a whole lot has happened here.

14:43.060 --> 14:51.670
But if we hit the play button look at the difference now it really has a lot more saturation to it really

14:51.670 --> 14:52.900
brings it alive I think.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.280
Now this may be too much.

14:54.280 --> 15:00.580
We can always adjust this a bit but as we begin setting up our materials and everything.

15:00.580 --> 15:04.890
I think this is going to help us get a sense of how it's going to look.

15:05.050 --> 15:12.910
So I'll hit the play button again to turn that off and we can take the saturation up and down here in

15:12.910 --> 15:15.560
the color correction component.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.100
Currently it's at 1.

15:17.200 --> 15:22.180
So I think that's going to help us as we set up our scene as well to kind of begin to get a sense of

15:22.180 --> 15:24.240
what the final look is going to be.
