00:00.720 --> 00:04.140
So we've exported our textures out of substance painter.

00:04.380 --> 00:11.830
Let's go into unity now and let's bring in our lamp and take a look at our textures.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.220
Now I've already brought in the end table here.

00:14.220 --> 00:19.260
I'll go ahead and click on that and drag it into the hierarchy and there it is.

00:19.290 --> 00:25.130
So I'll just place this maybe right over here and we'll put the lamp on top of that.

00:25.260 --> 00:32.540
So I'll open up a Finder window here grab this table lamp and drag it into the assets folder.

00:32.640 --> 00:38.310
If we drag this into the hierarchy there is our lamp.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.500
Put it over on the table there.

00:40.710 --> 00:47.080
I'll zoom in with the key and let's go about assigning our textures to the materials.

00:47.080 --> 00:54.490
If we open up the table lamp F.P. X-File here we can see we've got one object for the base one object

00:54.520 --> 00:57.250
for the lamp shade.

00:57.280 --> 01:07.740
So the base here I can take to pure white and if we go down into our textures folder and into our table

01:07.740 --> 01:14.930
lamp folder that we created earlier you can see here are the textures we generated out of substance

01:14.940 --> 01:16.200
painter.

01:16.200 --> 01:24.790
So here is our albedo or our color our metal smoothness and our normal maps.

01:25.040 --> 01:35.560
So with this base selected I will drag in the Al-Bayda here to that slot drag in the metal smoothness

01:35.560 --> 01:41.680
into the metal slot and drag the normal map into the normal map slot.

01:41.680 --> 01:48.490
Now once we do that we're going to have to click fix now to mark this as a normal map but then there

01:48.490 --> 01:49.770
we go.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.630
Now for the lamp shade Let's take a look at this.

01:52.630 --> 01:58.810
I want to select this and we've got our standard shader here that was created when we brought it in

01:59.400 --> 02:01.120
to change the color just a bit.

02:01.120 --> 02:08.450
I think I wanted to be more of kind of a off white kind of a color here something like that.

02:09.470 --> 02:18.130
I can reduce the metallic and the smoothness here and I'm going to change the emission color so that

02:18.130 --> 02:25.420
it's a little bit brighter so that it actually appears like light is coming out of it but that is just

02:25.420 --> 02:33.370
yet another example of how we can organize our objects and materials based on what we want to do with

02:33.370 --> 02:41.470
them in unity or in an external program like substance painter or pixel studio.

02:41.470 --> 02:47.680
So as I think about these walls now there's yet another scenario that we can talk about.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.300
What I'd like to do here is I want two different textures on these walls.

02:53.440 --> 02:59.500
So for say this wall here the one behind the couch.

02:59.650 --> 03:06.370
I want to have kind of an old stained or torn wallpaper texture on that.

03:06.460 --> 03:09.630
And I also want that over here on this wall.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.190
And I'd like that on this wall here.

03:12.190 --> 03:21.720
So in three of the walls now on the other walls I want some sort of painted texture like an old plaster

03:21.730 --> 03:26.960
wall that's maybe lost its paint or is peeling or something.

03:27.070 --> 03:32.770
And I want that texture on this wall here in the center here.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.690
This wall in the kitchen.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.910
And I want that painted texture on this wall as well.

03:39.910 --> 03:44.080
So I've got two different textures for each of those textures.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.770
I've got three different walls.

03:45.850 --> 03:52.870
Now if we go back to Blender Let's go back to blender and take a look at our U-V maps for these walls.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.420
Here's one here.

03:54.540 --> 04:03.350
Well go to my U-V editing screen lay out and let's take a look at the U.V. map for this all hit tab.

04:03.580 --> 04:08.080
Select all of the faces with the A key and there is.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.840
Are you the map now.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.950
It's not real optimized.

04:11.950 --> 04:15.650
There's a lot of empty space around here.

04:16.030 --> 04:24.730
What we could do is try and use up more of the space for our texture map here by including the U.V.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.100
maps of other objects.

04:26.100 --> 04:33.910
So let's say I also included this U.V. map and I also included

04:36.460 --> 04:44.200
this UAV map here what if I could get them all in one texture space so when the game is running it doesn't

04:44.200 --> 04:50.850
have to pull from multiple texture maps to apply the textures to these three objects.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.380
What we can do is build a single texture map for multiple objects.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.940
So let's think about how we might do that.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.950
First of all I think here I'll work with this map while we have it up.

05:03.070 --> 05:08.980
I'll go and hit the Beaky and I'm going to border select this piece right here I'm going to control

05:09.010 --> 05:15.610
up arrow to enlarge the screen here and I'm gonna hit G and just move it to the side for now.

05:16.030 --> 05:25.090
I'll take this U.V. map and this U-V map which is the baseboard up here and I'll move this up say up

05:25.090 --> 05:26.050
here.

05:26.050 --> 05:32.060
I'll put that right up here and this UVM map for the baseboard I'll put right down here.

05:33.290 --> 05:38.750
All right what I'll do is I will combine at least temporarily.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.230
Now this wall and this wall into one object.

05:42.380 --> 05:45.000
I don't necessarily want it to be on one object forever.

05:45.020 --> 05:49.910
I want to be able to have a little bit of control of what I do with it in unity so I can select one

05:49.910 --> 05:52.800
wall and move it back or move forward if I need to.

05:53.090 --> 05:58.260
But I can like this wall shift select that one in press control J.

05:58.370 --> 06:04.040
And now if I tab into that mode I can see both of the U-V maps.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.520
I'll take this piece and move it aside like that.

06:06.530 --> 06:09.020
These are the backs of the walls.

06:09.110 --> 06:12.630
I'll take this piece and move it up with this guy right appear.

06:14.120 --> 06:20.890
Move these baseboard U-V islands down to go along with this U-V island down here.

06:22.030 --> 06:30.440
All right now I'll select this one shift select the walls here and hit Control J again.

06:30.640 --> 06:37.490
NF I tab into edit mode here we have that U.V. map as well I'll take the back of the wall and move it

06:37.490 --> 06:39.340
aside for just a minute.

06:40.590 --> 06:44.550
I'll grab that baseboard U-V island and move it down.

06:46.050 --> 06:51.840
And I'll grab this wall right here and move it down just a bit as well.

06:53.260 --> 06:59.230
So now that we have all of the islands into one U-V map we can begin thinking about exporting this out

06:59.230 --> 07:00.660
to Photoshop.

07:00.660 --> 07:06.550
However there are a couple of issues we need to think about before we do that and we'll talk about that

07:06.850 --> 07:07.640
in the next video.
