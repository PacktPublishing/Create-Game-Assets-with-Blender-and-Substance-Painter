00:00.630 --> 00:05.220
So let's start working on these putting a little more detail on these I think first of all I've got

00:05.220 --> 00:11.390
them all selected I think I just want to move them to a new layer I'll press em and three.

00:11.550 --> 00:20.640
I miss that when they're three and move those all over here just so we can see them a little better.

00:20.640 --> 00:26.190
So first of all I think let's go ahead and establish where the counters are I'd like.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.200
Or the countertop scuse me.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.420
I'd like them to be as tall as this.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.730
No taller than this.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.390
So what I'm going to do for this is duplicated.

00:37.260 --> 00:45.240
And hit enter and then I'm going to tap into it mode and hit the Z key and I'm going to grab this.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.410
Bring it up.

00:47.810 --> 00:51.770
And then I'm going to grab this and bring it a little forward.

00:51.980 --> 00:57.620
So we kind of get a sense that we've got a countertop there I'll hit the Z key.

00:57.620 --> 00:57.850
All right.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.040
So there's our first countertop.

01:00.080 --> 01:08.630
Let me go ahead and tap into here and bring this one down just below that like say like Pat.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.830
And we go.

01:10.830 --> 01:11.160
All right.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.980
So that is our first countertop.

01:12.980 --> 01:16.180
We can now use this for the other ones.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.230
We'll go ahead and duplicate it.

01:18.570 --> 01:25.630
And let's go ahead and put the origin in the center of the geometry and move it over here.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.470
I'll scale it in the X and get it.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.790
So it fits in here.

01:30.960 --> 01:38.490
I'll hit the period key and let's also take this one and grab that face and move it down a bit.

01:41.300 --> 01:46.010
And we go maybe fit this one in here a little bit better.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.930
S and X OK.

01:50.380 --> 01:53.390
Now we can use these countertops for over here as well.

01:53.410 --> 01:58.810
Grab this center the origin into the geometry.

01:58.810 --> 02:01.180
Duplicate it and move it over here.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.510
And let's put this in place

02:07.590 --> 02:13.340
and we go let's pull this down this face down below it.

02:15.490 --> 02:25.530
That and of course with this one we can always grab that face over here and just drag that over.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.260
And there we go.

02:27.330 --> 02:27.590
All right.

02:27.590 --> 02:31.320
Now of course we're going to need to drop a sink into here.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.580
So we'll be cutting out a whole for that but that's OK for right now.

02:35.580 --> 02:43.190
We've got that countertop in place now as I said this is the kind of thing I want is kind of very plain

02:43.250 --> 02:46.800
and simple door here on the counters here.

02:46.800 --> 02:54.990
So for this I think what I'm going to do is we've got I needed to decide how many doors we're going

02:54.990 --> 02:56.390
to have here.

02:56.490 --> 02:59.170
I would say probably two pairs.

02:59.190 --> 03:04.760
So for the doors I think I'll grab this once again and duplicate it and pull it out.

03:05.070 --> 03:15.270
And now I will scale this in the y close that up like that little bit thinner and I'll put the origin

03:15.270 --> 03:23.990
in the center of the geometry scale it in the next let's scale it in the Z or at least what we can do

03:23.990 --> 03:27.400
is take this face and bring it down some.

03:27.530 --> 03:36.020
So let's go to that side and hit the control key and one spin it around to the front there hit Z and

03:36.020 --> 03:36.710
hit five.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.490
So I can kind of see it.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.110
Now we're going to a drawer here so I'll pull that down.

03:43.580 --> 03:50.020
And this will be our first cabinet door right here.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.990
Leave a little room for the hinges there.

03:53.050 --> 03:57.830
Duplicate this and move it over and we go now.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.940
Is this going to be wide enough.

04:03.550 --> 04:06.160
And now we need a drawer there don't we.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.840
So I'll just take one of these and duplicate it.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.420
Move it up scale it into the

04:18.580 --> 04:30.390
and then scale it in the X so there's a drawer for us I'll duplicate this shifty X and move it over

04:30.390 --> 04:30.950
here.

04:32.170 --> 04:37.180
Now it looks to me like way over here if we look at this we've got some drawers here we've got a thin

04:37.180 --> 04:42.510
one on top and they kind of get bigger as they go down so I'll just grab this.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.010
Duplicate it.

04:44.230 --> 04:49.560
Bring it over here and let's scale it in the X like so

04:52.610 --> 04:54.750
and then what we can do is duplicate it.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.210
Chef de Z bring it down and scale it in the z.

04:59.210 --> 05:07.640
Just a little bit and then shift the Z scale then the Z a little bit more again.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.030
And let's see if this one fits in here.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.770
And scale that up just a bit more

05:22.240 --> 05:23.070
and we go.

05:23.290 --> 05:27.650
So we've got a series of drawers.

05:27.650 --> 05:29.900
They're increasing in size.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.620
All right.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.080
Now looks good.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.040
Now for all of these we don't need the faces behind them do we.

05:39.390 --> 05:49.620
So what I'm gonna do is press shift h and then swing around here and get rid of all of these faces.

05:50.040 --> 05:59.220
Now while I'm here maybe I could actually combine all these together with control J and then tab into

05:59.850 --> 06:08.550
edit mode and just select all of these faces and hit X and delete faces and then you go.

06:08.760 --> 06:18.160
Now if we hit alt H and bring everything back we take these drawers and cabinets and bring them on back

06:18.160 --> 06:25.600
like this and for over on this side we're going to want the cabinet doors and the drawers but here under

06:25.600 --> 06:28.130
the sink it looks like it's just all cabinet.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.270
So let's see if we can do that.

06:30.280 --> 06:39.550
I'm going to grab these and just select these cabinets in one drawer and I'll press control plus key

06:39.550 --> 06:47.880
on the numpad to expand the selections so we select all of that and then duplicate and pull those out.

06:47.890 --> 06:56.140
Now I'm going to spin it around with our z 180 and then move these over here.

06:56.140 --> 07:02.410
Now I think I want to split this out from that side of the room or that side of the kitchen so I'll

07:02.410 --> 07:04.030
hit the P key.

07:04.030 --> 07:06.190
Choose separate by selection.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.110
And there we go.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.700
I think I might be able to give us another set of doors and drawer right here.

07:14.950 --> 07:19.750
So let's move that pivot point into the center of this object.

07:19.750 --> 07:23.680
So there's that object move the origin to the geometry.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.950
There it is.

07:25.030 --> 07:30.960
I'll hit shift D and X and move these over just a smidge and look at that.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.100
That's going to fit in there pretty well that's good.

07:34.210 --> 07:40.700
And then I probably want just smaller doors and drawer over here.

07:40.890 --> 07:48.850
So let's just duplicate that and move it over and I might be able just to scale and the X like that

07:50.090 --> 07:52.260
kind of squeeze that in there.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.650
And we go.

07:54.020 --> 08:01.910
Now I can take maybe these Once again I'll hover over here and hit the L key just like those duplicate

08:01.910 --> 08:02.390
those.

08:02.390 --> 08:12.540
Move them over peaky separate by selection and now I can scale these out in the next and up in the Zeb.

08:12.590 --> 08:19.970
First I need to move that pivot point or tap into object mode and move the pivot point to the geometry

08:21.080 --> 08:27.940
and then let's scale on the X like so.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.220
And scale and the Z and we go.

08:34.260 --> 08:38.280
So we're going to have some cabinets a little bigger there.

08:38.670 --> 08:39.000
Good.

08:39.030 --> 08:40.070
OK.

08:40.530 --> 08:41.550
So we have those.

08:41.550 --> 08:49.080
The next thing I think we want to do is the cabinets on top it looks like of course we're not going

08:49.080 --> 08:50.870
to need drawers up here.

08:51.150 --> 08:52.760
That won't be an issue.

08:53.130 --> 08:59.360
So once again I'll tab into edit mode and these I'll just hit the L key to select duplicate.

08:59.440 --> 09:09.900
Move them up get that control one key C and 5 and now I'll bring these up.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.460
Separate them by selection.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.120
Just select this one.

09:14.150 --> 09:15.680
There we go.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.900
And we can set that Orjan that's good OK.

09:19.090 --> 09:23.550
So let's scale it up and duplicate it.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.660
And Raquel same thing over here.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.780
Continue on over here.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.650
Duplicate it.

09:33.580 --> 09:44.020
Scale it to fit and for this over here I think we only need one door here so let me just grab this.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.600
Go into Edit Mode hover over one hit the key.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.000
Duplicate it.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.690
Move it over here.

09:51.810 --> 09:55.470
Hit that P key and separate it out.

09:55.470 --> 10:00.600
Now I'm going to select that in Object mode move the origin to the geometry.

10:00.790 --> 10:04.400
And now I can scale it out a bit like this.

10:04.440 --> 10:11.400
So I just needed one door there I think all we're gonna need some doors up here above the refrigerator

10:11.400 --> 10:16.500
so all duplicate those and move those over here.

10:16.530 --> 10:17.820
All right.

10:17.820 --> 10:23.280
So we're getting close to having at least the cabinets in the proper place.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.790
There we go.

10:27.250 --> 10:36.380
I'll select all of these moved them back and we could probably grab these and bring these over to the

10:36.430 --> 10:36.880
other side.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.160
I bet they'd fit.

10:38.410 --> 10:40.740
In fact all of these might fit her.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.260
Let's just go ahead and try it.

10:43.300 --> 10:46.660
I'll duplicate and move them all this way.

10:46.660 --> 10:49.840
So now I need to spin each one of these around individually.

10:49.840 --> 10:57.190
Let me grab this and hit our z 180 we can move that.

10:57.420 --> 11:04.170
And each one of these then are the 180.

11:04.220 --> 11:09.860
All right now it looks like it's hard to see over here but it looks like we've got doors for a little

11:09.860 --> 11:13.330
pantry and then maybe doors up here on top.

11:13.510 --> 11:18.800
I'm just going to have to guess on this shouldn't be too much of a problem.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.470
I don't think we're going to be over there a whole lot.

11:22.500 --> 11:30.090
But let's just take this and duplicate it and let's move it over and try and put it in place here.

11:30.100 --> 11:35.370
Let's now think about these handles and the hinges because we're going to need to make one each of these

11:35.370 --> 11:39.680
just one handle one hinge and then duplicate them all around.

11:39.690 --> 11:46.900
So I think to create the handle here I'm going to go to a whole new layer and I'm going to hit shift

11:46.900 --> 11:51.440
C to move that cursor to the center of the grid and I'll create a cube.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.440
And we're just going to use a cube to make one of these handles.

11:55.640 --> 12:03.700
Well scale it down a bit and I think what I'll do is split it down the middle so I'll press control

12:03.760 --> 12:08.440
r and hover over here and while that edge is right in the center.

12:08.440 --> 12:13.810
I'm just going to hit enter and then enter again and that will ensure that that split it right down

12:13.810 --> 12:21.850
the middle and then if I select these faces here I'll hit the B key and border select all of those and

12:22.120 --> 12:30.490
X and delete and then I can add a mirror modifier to this over here and the modifiers panel go to add

12:30.490 --> 12:32.790
a modifier and a mirror.

12:32.830 --> 12:40.060
And now if I mirror it in the y axis like that instead of the X will turn that one off.

12:40.090 --> 12:46.520
Now I can begin extruding this out to get the shape of this handle.

12:46.560 --> 12:51.690
Now it's a bit I think it's a bit thinner than this something like that.

12:52.210 --> 13:01.510
And if I begin say from this side with the three key I will hit the five key as well.

13:01.510 --> 13:07.300
Now I can begin thinking about getting this kind of shape here so I'll hit it to extrude and pull out

13:08.060 --> 13:12.560
and because I have the mirror modifier on it the other side comes along for the ride.

13:12.940 --> 13:24.510
So I kind of go like this and then like this and begin turning this a bit and extrude this down like

13:24.510 --> 13:29.700
that and maybe turn into a little bit more.

13:30.040 --> 13:40.550
Now I go ahead and hit me and extrude and I'll turn this like this scale in the Y and also scale the

13:40.550 --> 13:49.560
bit in the X like so now it doesn't look like it scales out in that axis so I'll undo that.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.790
It just looks like it scales out like that.

13:52.820 --> 13:55.920
So something like that.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.880
I'm going to select an edge or two and kind of move these around just a little bit and there we go.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.650
So we've got the basic shape here.

14:07.650 --> 14:17.730
Now I'll go ahead and delete these faces down here we don't need these X and faces and then let's see.

14:17.730 --> 14:20.690
I think that's going to be pretty good.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.430
Maybe I'll scale a bit in the Z.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.140
Make it a little bit flatter like that.

14:26.250 --> 14:30.080
I think perhaps I'll select these faces here.

14:30.150 --> 14:36.810
Allt click an edge between the faces and maybe smooth that let me try and go to that shading Uvas tab

14:36.810 --> 14:39.400
and smooth and see how that works.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.500
Yeah that helps a little bit on that top part.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.430
And now I want to just apply that mirror modifier to make it all one piece.

14:47.430 --> 14:54.870
Currently it's just half so if I took that mere modifier away or at least turned it off for a minute

14:55.200 --> 14:57.870
he'd see it's only half the object.

14:57.870 --> 15:06.190
So just hit apply Alt-Tab into object mode hit apply and now it's all one piece and we go.

15:06.510 --> 15:12.840
Now I'll bring back the other part of the scene and let's put our pivot point where it will be most

15:12.840 --> 15:18.140
useful I think it'll probably be most useful right in between here.

15:18.390 --> 15:25.650
So going to press shift s and move the cursor to the selected objects which are those two edges and

15:25.650 --> 15:33.960
then I'm going to move the pivot point the origin to the 3D cursor and there we go.

15:33.960 --> 15:41.010
So now as I scale it down it'll scale at that point and I can begin moving this over and trying to put

15:41.010 --> 15:42.460
it into place.

15:42.600 --> 15:53.440
So I'm going to rotate around the Z Z 90 and I want to rotate around the X as well so are x 9 0.

15:53.760 --> 15:59.460
So I'm going to try and get it on this drawer here and see how it looks.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.900
That may work out pretty well.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.500
Now let's bring back that floor.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.810
I'm going to shift click this layer here.

16:06.930 --> 16:10.710
I'll press shift F and the tab key and drop down to the ground.

16:10.710 --> 16:15.480
Now I can hit w a SD and come around in here.

16:15.660 --> 16:16.200
All right.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.270
So now we have our cabinets in.

16:18.270 --> 16:24.180
I'm going to duplicate these handles and fill in for the rest of the cabinets.

16:24.510 --> 16:31.110
And then in the next video we'll work on dealing with the stove and the refrigerator.
