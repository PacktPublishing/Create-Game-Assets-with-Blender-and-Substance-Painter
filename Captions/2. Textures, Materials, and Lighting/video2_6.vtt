WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:06.000
All right we're going to start working on modeling our assets and bringing them here into unity.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.020
But you know what I was thinking as we create these and as we texture them and bring them in here it

00:13.020 --> 00:19.410
would be nice to have the lighting set up here in the room a little bit more like it's going to be for

00:19.410 --> 00:26.910
the final version because take a look at the lamp here let me zoom in here with the F key and you can

00:26.910 --> 00:30.320
see the reflection on this object right.

00:30.390 --> 00:36.770
You can see that and all it is is the reflection of this big environment.

00:36.840 --> 00:44.620
Just that horizon line and the sky and that's not very realistic to what's going to be in the room.

00:44.640 --> 00:52.050
In addition this directional light here is more like sunlight in that it's just parallel rays of light

00:52.470 --> 00:59.160
spread out infinitely across the scene and lights the scene in a way that we really wouldn't see inside

00:59.160 --> 01:00.820
an interior room.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.550
And as I'm thinking about it this particular room is going to be the home of two guys who are trying

01:08.550 --> 01:09.620
to keep a secret.

01:09.660 --> 01:18.570
The overall project working on here is for this to be an apartment of people who are trying to hide

01:19.210 --> 01:22.490
I don't want people to see them so the blinds are closed.

01:22.500 --> 01:26.350
The place is usually pretty dark even during the day.

01:26.730 --> 01:33.750
So thinking about the story and and what's going to happen in this environment makes me think we should

01:33.750 --> 01:41.730
go ahead and work on some of the lighting now so that as we bring our other assets in we can get a sense

01:41.730 --> 01:47.340
of how they're going to look and what tweaks they might need in terms of the texturing and even the

01:47.340 --> 01:48.120
modeling.

01:48.450 --> 01:51.850
So let's think about lighting here.

01:52.020 --> 01:58.000
First of all let's deal with that reflection as we saw on the lamp here.

01:58.110 --> 02:03.440
The reflection here is just not at all appropriate for an indoor scene.

02:03.450 --> 02:13.020
What we can do is use an HDR image to kind of fake the reflections here that are happening on relatively

02:13.200 --> 02:14.340
shiny objects.

02:14.340 --> 02:23.370
So what I've done is I've gone out to Google and I've searched for HDR II images and I've used the search

02:23.370 --> 02:31.140
tools and chosen large and I've found some HDR images here that look pretty good.

02:31.140 --> 02:38.370
Now keep in mind if you are actually producing a game to sell you need to acquire the rights to images

02:38.370 --> 02:42.150
to use them right or create them on your own.

02:42.240 --> 02:52.850
But for our purposes here I want to find an image that is kind of an indoor scene.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.670
And I found one here I think this is going to be kind of nice.

02:56.970 --> 03:00.170
This image can be found at Lugar texture here.

03:00.180 --> 03:05.920
I'm going to open this up right here.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.670
So please go check them out.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.920
They have some nice textures here.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.520
So many use this image.

03:13.600 --> 03:19.630
So the reason why I like this it it's an interior scene it has the ceiling and floor it has some wood

03:19.630 --> 03:20.980
color to it.

03:20.980 --> 03:25.290
I think it's going to work well here in our scene so let's bring it in.

03:25.300 --> 03:31.670
I'm going to click and drag it right into my assets folder right here.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.890
And there we are.

03:34.950 --> 03:44.110
I want to select it and I want to change it from a texture to a cube map and hit apply.

03:44.300 --> 03:50.930
Now you can see that the texture has been kind of wrapped around a sphere here and this will give us

03:50.930 --> 03:55.420
the ability to apply this to a cube map material.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.770
So let's create that material now.

03:57.770 --> 04:06.170
I'm going to right click go to create material and let's call this let's call this HDR II.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.230
So we know what it is.

04:08.630 --> 04:17.870
And for this let's change the type of material or Shater it is from standard to Sky box and cube map

04:17.870 --> 04:19.280
right here.

04:19.280 --> 04:28.190
So now that we've done that we can take our cube map here and drag it right into the cube map here and

04:28.190 --> 04:29.330
there we go.

04:29.330 --> 04:33.520
Now you can see we're inside that cube map right.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.700
And you can see all around here.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.390
Now we need to apply this to the lighting of the scene.

04:40.400 --> 04:50.540
So here in lighting we want to drag our new cube map our HDR cube map here right into the skybox slot.

04:50.540 --> 04:57.560
So grab this drag it up here drop it there and now look what happens.

04:57.560 --> 05:05.540
The quality of the light changes quite a bit now because we're getting a huge amount of diffuse light

05:05.600 --> 05:07.460
coming from that image.

05:07.460 --> 05:16.160
And if we zoom in here and kind of tumble around you can see that the reflection is more what we would

05:16.160 --> 05:18.380
expect for an interior scene.

05:18.380 --> 05:25.400
We've got wood we've got a floor we've got ceilings so you can really get a sense that we're in an interior

05:25.400 --> 05:26.510
space.

05:26.510 --> 05:34.100
Now this particular scene has a kitchen right here and it's reflecting that kitchen counter here.

05:34.160 --> 05:40.930
We can change what is reflecting from this angle by rotating the image around the scene.

05:40.940 --> 05:48.800
So if I come back over here to the material and go back to the inspector we can see in the materials

05:48.980 --> 05:56.530
settings that we have this rotation field and we can click and drag that and maybe move the reflection

05:56.560 --> 05:57.640
around like that.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.260
So now we're not seeing that kitchen in the reflection.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.910
We can keep going on around and see what we can get.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.130
Yeah that's not bad there.

06:09.590 --> 06:13.570
So now we've got a different quality of light in here.

06:13.580 --> 06:19.280
And you know what we can also go ahead and take away that directional light and see what happens.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.540
All right click that and choose delete.

06:22.970 --> 06:30.730
And now we've got just a general diffuse light coming in from our HDR image here.

06:30.800 --> 06:38.840
So here it is now we're going to want to put other kinds of lights in here of course because we're going

06:38.840 --> 06:43.750
to need shadow light and dark areas pools of light.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.320
We're going to really want to try and create a mood with the lighting.

06:48.440 --> 06:54.800
So I do know that I'm going to have probably a bare bulb hanging over here somewhere kind of in the

06:54.800 --> 06:56.420
middle of the room.

06:56.480 --> 07:02.820
The guys who live here aren't real into the design and you know decoration.

07:02.840 --> 07:08.650
So I'm going to go and create just a point light at least for now just to get a sense of the scene.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.980
All right click over here.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.760
Choose light and point light.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.670
And there we go.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.200
So there's our point light.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.100
I'm going to drag it over here say it's going to be hanging right around here.

07:22.100 --> 07:28.610
I'm not exactly sure yet but I think maybe just kind of hanging a bare bulb right around here.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.180
And I want to get a sense of the shadows here as well.

07:33.280 --> 07:40.030
So we can come over here and with the lights selected I can turn on say hard shadows and you can begin

07:40.030 --> 07:41.920
to see them there.

07:41.920 --> 07:48.400
Now one thing about it is when you turn on the shadows you may notice that the Shadows are kind of separating

07:48.400 --> 07:54.310
out from the objects and one of the main things you need to ground and object to the floor to make it

07:54.310 --> 08:00.250
seem realistic is to have those shadows connecting with the object.

08:00.250 --> 08:03.870
So what we can do is change the bias.

08:03.870 --> 08:10.090
If you click and drag this you can see that you can take the shadow away from the object and bring it

08:10.090 --> 08:13.460
closer to the object like that.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.620
So I want to get it.

08:14.620 --> 08:19.260
So it's maybe like point to 0 or 1 really close there.

08:19.420 --> 08:27.520
You can also change this shadow near plane and you can see how it can move away from that as well.

08:27.780 --> 08:32.280
Well I want this pretty low down like that as well.

08:32.300 --> 08:41.540
Now we can also adjust to say the range of our point light so maybe it doesn't illuminate the whole

08:41.540 --> 08:48.170
scene maybe it just illuminates kind of that center part of the room so we can play with that quite

08:48.170 --> 08:49.110
a bit.

08:49.160 --> 08:54.520
What I'd also like to do is get rid of this image in the background here.

08:54.680 --> 09:01.280
To do that we can come over to the main camera under the player and under the clear flags we can change

09:01.310 --> 09:03.490
that to solid color.

09:04.770 --> 09:12.110
Change that black and for the viewport if we want to turn this off back here we can just come up here

09:12.110 --> 09:17.000
to this pull down and turn off the skybox There we go.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.620
So now we've got the Sky box in there.

09:20.640 --> 09:27.070
It isn't visible but it is visible still in our reflections here.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.420
So that's what we want.

09:31.060 --> 09:40.920
And if we run the game we can see that our reflections are still visible here in the lamp.

09:40.920 --> 09:50.390
So that's helped with the reflections and as we go through the process of creating and texturing our

09:50.390 --> 09:57.940
assets here we might want to say reduce the amount of light here in the room.

09:58.040 --> 10:04.060
We could always come back to our HDR material and we can reduce the exposure a bit.

10:04.130 --> 10:07.240
Turn it down a bit so it isn't quite so hot.

10:07.340 --> 10:12.950
So this will just allow us to try and get that final look of the scene as we go so we can really tell

10:12.950 --> 10:16.170
how our objects are going to look in the scene.

10:16.170 --> 10:22.580
Now I think what I'll do is go ahead and create a cube and scale it and bring it in for the roof or

10:22.580 --> 10:30.130
the ceiling here and maybe I'll go ahead and textured these walls as well in the same way we did these.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.360
And then we can begin moving on and creating more of the objects.
