WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:04.590
Now the last thing we need to do is check our scale.

00:05.050 --> 00:12.590
Let's go back to the default view and let's bring back some of our scene here.

00:12.590 --> 00:15.690
Maybe this maybe the walls actually.

00:15.710 --> 00:23.420
All we really need is our furniture here and now we need to scale this down to work with our furniture.

00:23.420 --> 00:30.320
So I'll hit the three key and the five key the Z key to go to wireframe and now I need to figure out

00:30.320 --> 00:31.970
kind of how big this is going to be.

00:31.970 --> 00:34.040
Let's rotate this around the z axis.

00:34.040 --> 00:43.120
Let's press our z 9 0 just so we can see it a little better and I'll just scale it down with the key

00:43.700 --> 00:50.110
and with that pivot point at the center of the grid we can see it scaling it down from the floor or

00:50.120 --> 00:52.850
the grid here.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.850
What do you think something like that.

00:55.860 --> 00:59.600
It's kind of hard to know exactly how big that should be.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.050
I'll take the scale back or the rotation back to zero and let's move that over here and just see how

01:07.050 --> 01:08.280
it looks.

01:09.590 --> 01:17.330
I'm going to press g and Shift Z and now I can slide it around in the y and x axis and if we kind of

01:17.330 --> 01:28.160
put it up near the couch here to try and get a sense of what it's going to be I think that feels to

01:28.160 --> 01:30.140
me about right.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.080
I'm going to go with that.

01:32.120 --> 01:38.690
So I want to go ahead and press control a and hit the scale for the transforms and apply that.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.520
And now we can do a little bit of scaling in unity if need be.

01:42.530 --> 01:46.340
But I think this is going to work let's give this a try.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.410
All right so if I want to go ahead and leave it there for now I can export this out.

01:51.410 --> 02:00.590
I can go to a file export and FBA X and I can make sure that selected objects is checked and I'll go

02:00.590 --> 02:07.250
ahead and export it out into the assets folder of our unity project and I'll call it TV.

02:07.340 --> 02:15.560
So let's hit export and then we go here in unity we can see it here it's come into the assets folder.

02:15.560 --> 02:23.750
It's also brought all of our TV materials in into the materials folder which is good that's what we

02:23.750 --> 02:24.590
want.

02:24.590 --> 02:30.170
I'll take that TV and drag it into the hierarchy and there it is now in here.

02:30.170 --> 02:32.650
It's looking a little too big isn't it.

02:32.660 --> 02:43.330
So we could bring it down a little bit here in the scale it's let's try 95.

02:43.390 --> 02:47.780
Let's even try let's try 90 and see how that works.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.570
Yeah kind of like that.

02:51.010 --> 02:55.300
Let's now bring in our textures here in the textures folder.

02:55.330 --> 03:04.310
I'll go ahead and bring up a Finder window here and here I'll find the TV color map and drag that in.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.280
And there we go.

03:06.340 --> 03:11.980
Now if we come in here and select the television we have multiple different materials that we're going

03:11.980 --> 03:12.960
to be using.

03:13.120 --> 03:20.200
We're going to use this same texture map in all of them but we're going to alter the smoothness and

03:20.560 --> 03:22.290
the metallic for each of them.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.040
Will let's work on the screen here first.

03:25.150 --> 03:32.240
I'm going to bring this to pure white just to get that ready and I'll bring in that texture map into

03:32.240 --> 03:33.670
the Al-Bayda.

03:33.950 --> 03:36.030
And there we go so we can see it there.

03:36.830 --> 03:45.730
Now we have an HDR image here in our scene so we should be able to see some reflections in here.

03:45.740 --> 03:50.300
Let's see if we can work on that I'm going to take the metallic all the way up and the smoothness all

03:50.300 --> 03:54.670
the way up and you can see there is the reflection of our environment.

03:54.680 --> 04:01.800
Now we don't want it that reflective of course but if we bring the metallic down just a bit and we bring

04:01.800 --> 04:06.610
the smooth this down some we can kind of get a

04:09.450 --> 04:10.980
slightly reflective

04:13.580 --> 04:14.870
material there yeah.

04:14.960 --> 04:23.340
So as we move around that being kind of see the basic reflections of the room yeah that's kind of nice.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.570
I like that.

04:24.610 --> 04:25.150
All right.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.200
Let's do something similar with that frame.

04:29.290 --> 04:35.250
So with the frame here I'll take that to white.

04:35.330 --> 04:38.730
Let's take that texture map into here.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.630
And for that frame let's try that again let's take it all the way up.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.310
There's what we can see.

04:45.990 --> 04:50.280
In that frame that's once again quite a bit too much.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.020
So let's bring that back down.

04:54.210 --> 05:04.570
And see if we can find here something like I don't want it too shiny but maybe something like that.

05:04.570 --> 05:17.100
All right let's try again with that fabric Let's bring this into our fabric or into the albedo and Rigaud.

05:17.190 --> 05:19.320
And for this we don't really need any

05:21.630 --> 05:24.360
reflection at all since it is fabric.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.000
I'm just going to take the metallic and the smoothen this way down here.

05:28.770 --> 05:30.150
Let's work with the wood.

05:30.150 --> 05:31.920
Now where is the wood.

05:31.920 --> 05:41.550
Here we go TV Wood let's drag our texture into their And we go.

05:41.970 --> 05:47.390
And now for this I think we do want some reflection here because this is kind of a veneer.

05:47.850 --> 05:54.520
It's not really metallic but I think it does have reflection so maybe not quite that much.

05:54.760 --> 06:00.350
Putting it down just a little bit like that something like that.

06:03.210 --> 06:07.450
So as we move around we can tell it has a bit of a shine to it.

06:09.790 --> 06:13.330
Maybe I'll take it down a little bit lower now.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.760
OK.

06:15.930 --> 06:20.320
These panels here let's work on that you know we go

06:23.950 --> 06:25.550
drag that into the Al-Bayda

06:28.480 --> 06:34.990
And these of course are a little bit more Metallik Let's take a look at the reflectivity that's probably

06:34.990 --> 06:36.430
too much.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.990
Let's bring it down.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.500
Kind of like that.

06:39.850 --> 06:40.960
All right.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.210
So there we have our television set up.

06:43.210 --> 06:50.050
Let's take a look at it in game since we have some color correction on our camera recall that we put

06:50.380 --> 06:54.100
both anti-aliasing and color correction on our camera.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.290
Let's take a look at what that looks like.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.350
Yeah I like the reflection of the TV tube.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.460
I like that.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.930
Yeah I think that works pretty well.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.330
I think it may still be a little bit too big.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.860
I may want to take it down just a little bit.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.200
I think that's looking pretty good.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.020
So let's clean up a little in here.

07:18.020 --> 07:27.120
I'll take my TV into the models folder and in the materials yeah I'll go ahead and leave these out.

07:27.140 --> 07:33.230
We could begin creating folders for these to put all the materials for the walls for the TV for the

07:33.230 --> 07:35.380
lamp et cetera.

07:35.450 --> 07:41.780
But I think I'll go ahead and leave them out the naming conventions I think allow us to separate them

07:41.780 --> 07:44.070
out pretty well here.

07:44.090 --> 07:48.530
Now we really need to go through and think about the materials for all of the other objects that we've

07:48.530 --> 07:49.870
put in the room.

07:49.970 --> 07:54.010
We haven't really done that with any of the other objects so take this floor.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.950
We're still using the default settings of this material.

07:59.030 --> 08:04.040
What we can do is let's take a look at the material within the materials folder I'll just select floor

08:04.040 --> 08:09.190
here and you can see that material a sample of it here.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.420
This is a pretty good view to adjust your material I kind of like doing it here.

08:14.470 --> 08:17.880
We did it in the viewport and that worked just fine.

08:18.190 --> 08:26.740
But here you can really see the changes in the material here see how you can see the reflection here

08:26.740 --> 08:27.810
as well.

08:27.820 --> 08:33.220
So this is a good place to work on setting up your materials to kind of isolate it apart from the rest

08:33.220 --> 08:34.400
of the scene.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.580
So this is not a metallic object.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.280
It's true.

08:38.220 --> 08:41.870
Let's take that down and it shouldn't be that smooth.

08:41.900 --> 08:47.580
I don't think so maybe give it a little bit more smoothness like that.

08:47.580 --> 08:55.510
Now you can tell the way material is going to feel the the quality of the material by the highlight

08:55.570 --> 08:56.340
on it.

08:56.350 --> 09:02.200
So as we take the smoothness down you can see that that highlight begins to spread out.

09:02.320 --> 09:10.360
So as we increase it that highlight gets very sharp indicating to us that that's a very reflective smooth

09:10.390 --> 09:11.300
object.

09:11.650 --> 09:18.480
So it's this highlight that I tend to look at as I set up a material as I play with the settings here.

09:18.490 --> 09:25.740
So for me it's a little bit more of a worn material so it wouldn't be quite that sharp of a highlight.

09:25.870 --> 09:32.740
So if I kind of bring it back some that highlight begins to disperse a little bit kind of cueing us

09:32.740 --> 09:37.610
that it's an older worn and not as shining of a material.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.780
So let's go with that for now.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.380
Each one of these objects I think we need to go through and do that.

09:44.380 --> 09:52.570
So for say this table we've got two materials here the top and the wood.

09:52.570 --> 09:56.890
So I could come over here to the materials area and just deal with the top.

09:57.070 --> 10:01.240
See if I can find some settings that work pretty well here.

10:01.240 --> 10:09.670
Now this is not really metallic surface and it's probably not a real reflective surface.

10:09.660 --> 10:15.350
To me it seems old and kind of decayed or worn.

10:15.370 --> 10:23.510
So something like that maybe the wood on the table maybe a little bit shiny or it's not a metallic saw

10:23.530 --> 10:30.430
Keep it low for the metallic setting and for the smoothness or kind of bring that back and give it a

10:30.430 --> 10:34.180
little bit of a sheen but not a lot.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.880
Something like that.

10:35.950 --> 10:42.970
So what you can do is go through your materials individually like this and really concentrate on how

10:42.970 --> 10:49.590
that specular highlight looks and what that communicates about the material in the scene.
