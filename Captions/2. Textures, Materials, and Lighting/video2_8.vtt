WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:05.990
Well now that we have are seen fairly well arranged here I mean we hit the Zeek here to go to wireframe

00:06.000 --> 00:10.680
we've got the basic lay out down we've got some textures on it.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.560
We've imported it into unity to kind of get a sense of how it feels and whether or not it's going to

00:16.560 --> 00:17.410
work.

00:17.430 --> 00:24.660
I think now we can begin cranking out the assets filling up the space and kind of giving it a sense

00:24.660 --> 00:26.080
that it's lived in.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.560
So what we need to do is just begin working on creating more the objects in the room.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.310
I think the next one I want to create is an old TV love.

00:35.330 --> 00:41.260
I love these old TVs here let me go to my finder here and bring this up.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.880
I think I want to add one of these.

00:43.950 --> 00:48.480
So something like this one of these old TVs that you know doesn't work anymore.

00:48.510 --> 00:49.950
Right.

00:50.190 --> 00:56.070
I get the sense that these are guys who live in this apartment just moved in.

00:56.190 --> 01:02.150
And it was already furnished with old junky furniture that had been there for decades.

01:02.280 --> 01:09.960
So my sense is this TV is in there is in the apartment but it doesn't work it's just a piece of junk

01:09.960 --> 01:11.830
that they haven't thrown out.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.380
You know that they just live with because they have other concerns.

01:15.390 --> 01:20.310
So I want to model this as I think about it.

01:20.370 --> 01:26.880
I think it's going to be several different materials so as you begin modeling Now think back to the

01:26.880 --> 01:34.590
way we set up our objects and materials the different ways we did that and begin planning ahead for

01:34.590 --> 01:37.200
what you want to do as you create new objects.

01:37.200 --> 01:46.200
So for this I think what I want to do is create the main wood piece as one object and one material.

01:46.350 --> 01:49.610
I want to create this frame here as another material.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.520
It can be the same object joined together.

01:53.520 --> 01:59.320
But I think it needs to be another material from the wood grain because the woods are going to be different

01:59.690 --> 02:05.040
shiny ness a different roughness than this part here.

02:05.040 --> 02:11.940
And I think the TV screen the the actual tube screen here needs to be pretty reflective So I think I

02:11.940 --> 02:17.280
want this to be yet another material perhaps even another object.

02:17.550 --> 02:24.740
And then these here these knobs and plate need to be its own material.

02:25.170 --> 02:34.170
And then this down here and the screen here needs to be there room materials so they can accept the

02:34.170 --> 02:34.710
texture.

02:34.710 --> 02:40.740
Now I've got some textures here that I've found that I want to use.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.150
So here's that speaker fabric.

02:44.150 --> 02:45.230
I like this.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.740
I'm going to use that on the TV here.

02:47.790 --> 02:51.110
Now let me just open this and open this.

02:51.110 --> 02:54.370
There we go so we can see them at the same time.

02:54.470 --> 02:57.460
So I want to use this fabric here.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.100
I think that will work pretty well.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.620
And I want to use this name plate.

03:03.620 --> 03:07.840
You can just kind of see that it's pretty small but I think I can use it.

03:07.850 --> 03:12.950
I want to use this name plate right down here.

03:12.950 --> 03:16.400
I know I'm going to need several different materials.

03:16.400 --> 03:21.520
The question is is do I need or want several different objects.

03:22.220 --> 03:28.940
Will See I kind of get the sense that maybe this whole frame this whole box of the television will be

03:28.940 --> 03:32.370
one object and this screen will be another object.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.360
We'll see.

03:33.740 --> 03:42.860
And of course we should probably make the U-V map all one U-V texture all one texture map so everything

03:42.860 --> 03:44.330
that needs to go on here.

03:44.330 --> 03:49.970
Everything that needs to be U-V map should be all on one texture map.

03:50.030 --> 03:56.350
Even though we have multiple materials and maybe even multiple objects.

03:56.450 --> 04:04.310
So let's start with a clean layer or maybe take the objects in these layers here and just hit the A.E.

04:04.310 --> 04:10.910
to select them all and just move them over to Lehre to all hit em and 2 and that will move them over

04:10.910 --> 04:12.040
to here.

04:12.230 --> 04:19.790
Now I have them all on these layers so now I can you say this layer here I'll bring in an image of that

04:19.790 --> 04:25.640
television I'll come over here and click on this little tab right here drag down create a new window

04:25.670 --> 04:33.710
and let's switch it to a U.V. image editor right here click open and I'll go find that reference image

04:33.710 --> 04:37.780
I have here it is right in here.

04:39.190 --> 04:39.720
There we go.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.840
So this is what we're going to be working on.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.120
So to begin with It looks like we need a cube right.

04:46.140 --> 04:54.060
Let's go ahead and create a cube over here and see if we can scale this to an approximate size.

04:54.090 --> 05:01.390
I'll swing around here and let's s x and scale out in the X just a bit.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.980
Something like that.

05:06.200 --> 05:11.500
Maybe we don't need it quite as tall a press S and Z and scale it down just a bit.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.750
Something like that.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.310
And does it need to be quite that deep.

05:18.310 --> 05:19.300
They are pretty deep.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.500
Let's go ahead scaling just a bit.

05:22.750 --> 05:27.020
So there's kind of the general shape of the object.

05:27.040 --> 05:33.580
Now if we look here we've got some areas that we need to block out with Edge loops so we need some edge

05:33.580 --> 05:35.310
loops along in here.

05:36.060 --> 05:39.990
We need some edge loops up and down right through here.

05:40.560 --> 05:47.190
And it looks like there's a little bit of a ridge around the front here as well so we're probably going

05:47.190 --> 05:49.280
to need edge loops there.

05:49.290 --> 05:58.050
Let's begin with those front ridges Alt-Tab and edit mode press control are and all scroll the mouse

05:58.050 --> 05:59.820
wheel and create two edges.

05:59.820 --> 06:04.350
There two edge loops all hit s and Z and scale those up.

06:04.350 --> 06:12.540
So they come close to the edges there and I'll do the same thing for the vertical edges and S and X

06:12.540 --> 06:16.440
and scale out to here let's say.

06:16.690 --> 06:19.670
Now let's get to these edges here.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.650
We probably need one write in here

06:27.130 --> 06:32.610
something like this perhaps another write in here.

06:33.340 --> 06:37.770
Let's get a couple more edges for this part here.

06:38.230 --> 06:46.360
Let's go with control are and maybe two more edge loops in scale those in the Z till we get to about

06:48.070 --> 06:50.190
here let's say.

06:50.260 --> 06:56.350
So I think what I'll do is grab these faces in the center here I'll press the C key for the circle select

06:56.350 --> 06:58.400
tool and just click and drag and slide.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.450
These faces here.

07:00.600 --> 07:09.160
I just want to extrude and I'll hit me and drag in just a bit to get those edges on the front that will

07:09.160 --> 07:09.810
work there.

07:09.820 --> 07:14.830
Now it looks like this piece pushes in a little bit.

07:14.830 --> 07:21.610
So maybe these three now can push in just a hair more.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.620
No maybe just this one here.

07:23.650 --> 07:28.310
Yeah I think just that one there I'll hit and push in just a little more.

07:28.350 --> 07:29.830
There we go.

07:29.950 --> 07:36.290
Now for that frame around the tube what we can do is just use this piece right here.

07:36.340 --> 07:42.370
I'm going to split this out into its own object for now so that if I need to insert edge loops or do

07:42.370 --> 07:48.010
anything to it I won't extend those edge loops out to the other part of the object.

07:48.070 --> 07:52.150
I want to just isolate what I'm doing to this particular piece.

07:52.150 --> 07:58.950
So with this face selected I'll hit the P key and I will separate it out by selection.

07:59.320 --> 08:05.400
Now if I tab back into object mode and just select that one piece I can tab into edit mode.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.960
And here is that face.

08:07.990 --> 08:18.520
So now I can hit E and extrude in all scale in a bit like so now I've got duplicate faces in here I'm

08:18.520 --> 08:27.460
going to go ahead and delete these I want to hit X and faces and again x and faces.

08:27.460 --> 08:31.390
Now I can grab these edges here with Allt click.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.950
Now I have that edge and here's that edge right here.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.680
Now I can extrude that in a bit.

08:36.700 --> 08:43.420
I'll hit the and click and then I'll drag in some like that and it looks like it's scales in just a

08:43.420 --> 08:48.950
hair like this.

08:48.950 --> 08:49.740
There we go.

08:49.850 --> 09:01.800
And then I'll extrude and again hit the and I'll hit s and scale in and now we've got this kind of curved

09:01.830 --> 09:05.610
area here and this is what I meant about those edges.

09:05.610 --> 09:11.640
I want to be able to insert edge loops to get this kind of curve without extending them all the way

09:11.670 --> 09:13.100
around the object.

09:13.140 --> 09:17.910
So I'm just going to do say three edge loops here.

09:18.690 --> 09:22.330
And I'll do the same thing over here like that.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.840
And now I can begin to bring these things in.

09:24.840 --> 09:31.790
So let's say I grab this edge in this hedge and I'll scale it in the X and here we go.

09:32.960 --> 09:40.430
And let's say Now I do this point and this point this vertex and this vertex and scale those in just

09:40.430 --> 09:41.930
a bit and we go.

09:41.930 --> 09:46.380
Now we're just kind of getting that rounded featured there.

09:47.280 --> 09:52.660
And maybe I can even select these edges and pull them back just a bit like this.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.120
Something like that.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.190
All right.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.180
Let's give that a try for now.

09:58.450 --> 09:59.830
We can smooth this.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.940
I'll come over here to tools and smooth and see how that looks.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.270
That looks OK.

10:05.290 --> 10:08.190
I can flatten the edges all the way around this.

10:08.200 --> 10:16.040
If I go back to face mode and click between two of the faces to select that whole face loop.

10:16.300 --> 10:24.190
Now here in edit mode I can go to shading Uvas and just hit flat for the faces there and now it will

10:24.280 --> 10:27.930
differentiate that a little bit from the smooth part.

10:27.940 --> 10:37.780
There I think I do want to bring this out a bit like this and then grab that edge and extrude it back

10:37.780 --> 10:46.210
just to separate it from the wood part of the television I'll hit E and then pull that back a bit and

10:46.210 --> 10:51.070
we go just so we can see a little bit of an edge there.

10:52.870 --> 10:53.780
All right.

10:54.100 --> 10:58.870
I think I'd also like to see more of a beveled edge along here.

10:58.870 --> 11:07.540
Now where we would be adding a fair amount of polygons to this but I'd like to try and see how it looks.

11:07.570 --> 11:16.970
So if I Allt click this edge shift or click this yes and this lets try and bevel this.

11:16.970 --> 11:24.580
Now using bevel you need to think about your transforms applying your transforms in the same way we

11:24.580 --> 11:27.280
did when we're U-V mapping.

11:27.280 --> 11:36.970
So if I hit the N key and come over here an object you can see that my scale is nonuniform that's going

11:36.970 --> 11:39.370
to be a problem once again with our bevelling.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.740
So I'll hit control a and choose scale.

11:43.090 --> 11:46.820
And now with these edges selected I'll press control B.

11:46.900 --> 11:54.060
Hold the shift key down to move the mouse very slowly you know kind of expand this out and I'll give

11:54.060 --> 11:57.220
it maybe one or two segments.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.770
There we go.

11:58.770 --> 12:04.050
All right so now we have that beveled edge there that looks kind of nice.

12:04.050 --> 12:11.580
I also want to take this edge on the inside and I want to pull those in just a bit just a little bit

12:11.580 --> 12:14.980
like this something like that.

12:15.930 --> 12:16.340
All right.

12:16.350 --> 12:24.160
Let's take this edge here and just extrude this in I'll hit the and then pull it in a bit like that

12:25.950 --> 12:26.920
and then we go.

12:27.120 --> 12:36.630
So now we need to add our television tube and our plates here with our knobs and in the next video we'll

12:36.810 --> 12:38.290
continue working on that.
