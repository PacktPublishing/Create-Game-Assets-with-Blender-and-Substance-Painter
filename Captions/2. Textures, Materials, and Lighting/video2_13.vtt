00:00.810 --> 00:04.020
Well we're doing pretty well here in this living room area.

00:04.020 --> 00:08.860
I mean we could probably go ahead and clean this up a bit as well.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.460
Grab these and just drag them into the furniture group there.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.610
So we clean the hierarchy up just a little bit.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.250
But I think maybe I'd like to go ahead and begin working over here in the kitchen and in this area I

00:23.250 --> 00:30.320
want to create some cabinets a stove a fridge maybe a sink over here.

00:30.630 --> 00:34.170
We had that reference image that we used at the beginning.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.830
Let's go back and take a look at that.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.300
Here it is right here.

00:40.400 --> 00:49.070
So I think I'd like to use this as the pattern for the kitchen stove and refrigerator on this side sink

00:49.070 --> 00:53.920
on this side and the cabinet configuration pretty much like this.

00:53.930 --> 01:02.810
However I would like to use this image here as a reference for the actual cabinets I really kind of

01:02.810 --> 01:09.410
want them to be pretty nasty like this and that kind of faded dirty formica.

01:09.430 --> 01:15.440
And this is just pretty gross and I don't know if I'm going to have this much junk up on the sink or

01:15.440 --> 01:22.310
up on the cabinets but I am going to have some stuff this is as I said this is a place where people

01:22.310 --> 01:27.900
live or they're not real worried about housekeeping per se.

01:28.010 --> 01:34.520
So I think I'm going to go with this for the cabinets for the floor here.

01:34.640 --> 01:41.510
I realize that I may also want some of that linoleum floor here in the kitchen but I'll worry about

01:41.510 --> 01:45.140
that after I get the cabinets in and see how it looks.

01:45.140 --> 01:51.880
But yeah I may want some of that really old peeling worn linoleum in here as well.

01:52.310 --> 01:58.660
But let's go back to blender and begin working on blocking out the kitchen cabinets.

01:58.670 --> 02:05.330
So I've gone ahead and brought in these images over here in my U-V image editors just so I can keep

02:05.330 --> 02:11.540
them in mind as I build it out the cabinets here are pretty much just cubes and I think what I'll do

02:11.540 --> 02:14.160
is block them in first.

02:14.360 --> 02:20.870
I'll go ahead and just use cubes to get a basic sense of how big these things should be on the ground

02:20.900 --> 02:23.750
end up attached to the walls here.

02:23.870 --> 02:28.580
And I just want to try and get the size in proportion right before I begin detailing it.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.170
So let's try that.

02:30.260 --> 02:38.380
I'm going to grab this ceiling and over here I can turn off the eye to take away the visibility of it.

02:38.390 --> 02:41.090
Now we can also just select it and hit H.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.320
And that would hide it as well.

02:43.370 --> 02:46.370
And when we went to bring it back we just press alt H.

02:46.670 --> 02:50.200
Or what we can do is come over and turn on the eye again.

02:50.210 --> 02:55.220
So with that out of the way I'll hit the Z key so we can see in here.

02:55.650 --> 03:01.960
And let's take a look at just kind of blocking in some of this space.

03:01.970 --> 03:06.320
So if I come over here to the Create tab and click cube here we have a cube.

03:06.610 --> 03:11.300
I will go ahead and hit the one key and the five key and the Z key.

03:11.660 --> 03:15.420
And let's see if we can put these in place.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.480
Maybe I'll hit the three key so you can see there we go.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.010
We can see the kitchen a little better.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.180
Let's bring this over here.

03:23.180 --> 03:29.480
Shrink it down and kind of get it in a position kind of like this.

03:29.480 --> 03:37.840
I'm kind of working off of this right here so maybe skillet in a bit get it right up against the wall

03:37.840 --> 03:39.920
there.

03:40.210 --> 03:48.470
Move it over a bit and just try and scale it and get it the proper size.

03:48.470 --> 03:57.470
We could also bring up our quad view by pressing control alt cue and that will bring up our view here

03:58.160 --> 04:05.230
where we can see everything all views the top the front and the right all at once.

04:05.240 --> 04:12.520
All right so over here I'll hit the five key to go back to perspective view over here.

04:12.770 --> 04:17.890
And let's see if we can just get this in place maybe something like this.

04:19.130 --> 04:24.770
And I'm letting it hover above the ground because there's that piece right down here that's kind of

04:25.010 --> 04:26.140
indented.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.230
I'm going to want to leave room for that.

04:29.720 --> 04:35.330
So maybe maybe that's about the same height as the baseboard right there.

04:35.330 --> 04:41.570
Feels like it may be a little bit small Let me tab into edit mode and just select that face on top and

04:41.570 --> 04:43.470
bring it up a little bit.

04:43.490 --> 04:43.880
All right.

04:43.880 --> 04:48.800
I'm going to then block in what would be the stove here.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.950
So let's duplicate this and move it in the X and let's scale it up just a bit.

04:56.950 --> 04:59.230
It looks like it's a little bit taller.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.730
And a little bit wider.

05:04.270 --> 05:15.880
We grab this and move it over to the other side shift d x move it over there and then let's try and

05:15.880 --> 05:19.710
place this here and now the refrigerator.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.130
We've got some room here.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.140
This wall is a little bit longer.

05:23.140 --> 05:26.720
It looks like than the one in the picture and that's fine.

05:26.770 --> 05:32.710
I'm going to grab the stove and move it over and use this for the refrigerator.

05:32.710 --> 05:37.950
So let's just say that that refrigerator is a little bit wider

05:40.700 --> 05:42.060
a little bit taller.

05:42.220 --> 05:42.840
Right.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.430
Maybe something like that.

05:50.530 --> 05:54.320
And also it looks like it comes out even farther than the stove.

05:54.790 --> 05:57.830
You could push this back against the wall over here.

05:59.150 --> 06:08.100
And then we'd have a little more room for a counter over here.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.700
Let's see how this works here.

06:11.910 --> 06:16.940
All right so we've got a little bit more counter space there that should work OK.

06:17.830 --> 06:25.090
Now over here on this side we're going to want it looks like we have a pantry and that counter space

06:25.090 --> 06:35.240
there and the pantry looks like it's at least as wide as the refrigerator let's grab this move it over

06:38.990 --> 06:46.130
and this looks like it could go up pretty much to the ceiling almost and for this counter over here

06:46.160 --> 06:49.470
I'll just grab this and move it straight over

06:52.630 --> 07:01.590
and grab that face over here and just move it all the way we go.

07:01.870 --> 07:10.390
So now how does that feel what I'm going to do is press control alt cue and I'm going to end here press

07:10.690 --> 07:17.840
shift F and tab and then I'm going to run around here and just see how this feels.

07:19.420 --> 07:22.750
So the refrigerator could be a little bit bigger

07:25.760 --> 07:28.320
the countertops don't feel too bad.

07:32.800 --> 07:39.140
Yeah so I think in terms of the scale of what's over here.

07:40.060 --> 07:45.400
And coming into here I think that feels right.

07:45.410 --> 07:52.130
I think the countertops are going to be at the very top of this so I'm not going to place the countertops

07:52.190 --> 07:53.660
on top of these cubes.

07:53.660 --> 07:57.140
I think the top of the cubes are going to be the top of the countertop.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.070
I think I have to make them that big.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.940
But other than that I think that's pretty good.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.630
Let me try.

08:04.630 --> 08:12.670
I'm going to hit escape and let me block in those upper cabinets as well here.

08:12.800 --> 08:19.770
So let me just grab this and duplicate it and let's move it up all the way to the ceiling.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.100
Where is the ceiling.

08:21.230 --> 08:25.070
Let's bring that back here.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.440
OK.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.930
So let me just bring this up

08:32.520 --> 08:33.640
like that.

08:34.110 --> 08:34.550
All right.

08:34.560 --> 08:41.010
So if that's our ceiling me go ahead and hide that again if that's our ceiling.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.590
Now let's go ahead and scale this the why.

08:43.590 --> 08:47.580
Because these are just quite a bit narrower than the bottom ones.

08:48.910 --> 08:53.040
That now we've got that part over the stove.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.290
Well I'll go ahead and move that over.

08:57.880 --> 09:05.870
And let's take a look at it from an orthographic view I want to press control one and that should spin

09:05.870 --> 09:09.810
me around to that side and then hit the 5 key.

09:09.890 --> 09:14.840
Now I can kind of get a sense of where I'm going with this.

09:14.980 --> 09:20.670
So if this is over the stove

09:23.330 --> 09:33.980
grab that face and move it up and it looks like if I duplicate it and move it over here over the refrigerator.

09:36.600 --> 09:44.130
Better center the origin here origin to geometry and then I'll just pull that out.

09:45.600 --> 09:52.070
Get it right above the refrigerator and maybe that needs to be a little bit higher like that.

09:52.070 --> 10:00.820
Now this let's center the geometry there again duplicated and let's move this over here and scale that

10:00.820 --> 10:02.510
down.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.790
All right let's see how that works now.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.740
Not sure if I got it all in the right place.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.520
Not too bad.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.020
So now we can take

10:14.440 --> 10:17.280
pretty much all of this here.

10:18.680 --> 10:24.810
And take it over to the other side like that.

10:24.840 --> 10:30.600
Now we've got our area for the sink right here right across from the stove.

10:30.990 --> 10:31.410
All right.

10:31.410 --> 10:36.960
So once again I can press shift F and the TAB key dropped down to the ground and let's run around in

10:36.960 --> 10:38.780
here and see see what we think.

10:41.490 --> 10:49.340
Fridge Rayder cabinets stove sink pantry.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.530
It's not too bad.

10:52.190 --> 10:54.360
I think the scale of it is pretty good.

10:55.550 --> 10:56.370
All right.

10:56.600 --> 11:05.150
So in the next video we'll begin detailing these getting the countertops on the drawers the cabinet

11:05.150 --> 11:07.280
doors the handles things like that.
