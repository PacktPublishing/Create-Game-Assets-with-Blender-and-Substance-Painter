00:00.750 --> 00:05.880
You know I think now that I'm looking at this what would probably be a good idea is to go ahead and

00:05.880 --> 00:13.830
U-V map the cabinets here on this side of the kitchen on its own U-V map and then over here on this

00:13.830 --> 00:23.010
side of the kitchen have it be its own U-V map and then have individual U-V maps for the stove and the

00:23.010 --> 00:29.110
refrigerator and maybe even the sink as well that could be its own object with its own U-V map.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.540
So that seems like a fairly logical way to split this up.

00:33.540 --> 00:39.180
There are of course a lot of ways you could do it but I think for our purposes that's probably going

00:39.180 --> 00:41.150
to be a good way to do it.

00:41.190 --> 00:47.520
So if we're going to U-V map this side of the room lease the cabinets and the countertops for this side

00:47.520 --> 00:52.650
of the room is a couple of things we need to do to clean up before we begin.

00:52.650 --> 00:59.130
First of all I'd like to put a little backsplash right back here at the back of the counter so I'll

00:59.130 --> 01:06.390
just take this piece here and I think I'll just duplicate it and I'll move it up and I will scale this

01:06.480 --> 01:09.870
into shape for that backsplash.

01:09.880 --> 01:19.370
It's probably going to be about let's say that wide and S and Z and maybe about that tall.

01:19.480 --> 01:27.560
Let's see a frame up with the period key and let's see I think it could be a little bit taller.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.120
And there we go.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.030
Yeah I think that'll work.

01:34.190 --> 01:39.380
I'll go ahead and take this and move it over to the other side I'll duplicate it and hit Y and move

01:39.380 --> 01:41.180
it over here.

01:41.300 --> 01:47.970
It looks like we could go ahead and extend this one all the way across like this.

01:47.970 --> 01:55.850
I think that would be a backsplash behind the sink there and then let's go ahead and take this one that

01:55.850 --> 02:02.480
we created first and duplicate and hit X and let's move this one over here.

02:05.230 --> 02:05.640
All right.

02:05.650 --> 02:10.430
So we have our one wall of cabinets here ready to go.

02:10.450 --> 02:18.670
The next thing I'll do before I begin U-V mapping is try and take away everything I don't need like

02:18.760 --> 02:24.800
back here we don't need the faces back here like that.

02:25.360 --> 02:32.050
And this one as well so I'll go through and just remove all the faces in the back here and it's just

02:32.050 --> 02:34.710
going to make it easier to a map.

02:34.780 --> 02:39.900
In addition to removing unneeded polygons.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.940
All right so I have those removed.

02:43.250 --> 02:49.850
I see that I've forgotten to add that piece at the bottom this little indented piece here at the bottom.

02:49.850 --> 02:59.390
Let's go ahead and add that I can grab this part of the cabinet right here and duplicate that.

02:59.390 --> 03:00.830
Move it down.

03:00.930 --> 03:11.430
I'll scale it in just a bit and then scale it in the z and we could probably put it right back here

03:11.430 --> 03:13.260
like this.

03:13.290 --> 03:20.040
All right so I will go ahead and remove the top and bottom faces here we don't need those.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.080
That'll just make it more difficult to U-V map.

03:24.390 --> 03:30.340
I'll hit the three key and the five key and let's bring this up in the here.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.840
Saying like this

03:37.300 --> 03:42.810
and I'll grab that face and just looks like it needs to be right about there.

03:42.980 --> 03:43.390
OK.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.230
So that I think will work for that.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.530
We'll also want that over here on the other one.

03:49.700 --> 03:56.930
So I'll go to the top view and with wireframe in orthographic view go ahead and duplicate this and hit

03:56.930 --> 04:07.860
the x key and bring it over here and scale it down the X and we go all right.

04:07.930 --> 04:11.420
So now we have those pieces in place as well.

04:11.560 --> 04:20.850
I could probably go ahead and take this one duplicate it and move it over all swing it around the z

04:20.850 --> 04:26.730
axis by R Z 180 and let's put it in over here.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.820
So and move it all the way down.

04:32.770 --> 04:36.480
With this face here I'll just move this all the way down to here.

04:37.910 --> 04:38.700
OK.

04:39.110 --> 04:40.830
So now we have those.

04:41.010 --> 04:46.770
Now we can actually begin working on this side and U-V mapping.

04:46.770 --> 04:53.300
I will also go ahead and take away the backs of the backsplash.

04:57.700 --> 05:07.650
And the backs of the kitchen counter as well where the countertops we go.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.860
So we don't have to deal with U-V mapping those.

05:10.860 --> 05:18.100
Now it's possible that we could get rid of these faces down here.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.420
We could also get rid of these faces up top.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.980
I'm not sure though I'm going to go ahead and leave those.

05:24.990 --> 05:28.640
There's maybe a 2 percent chance that we might ever see those.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.300
But I'll go ahead and leave them as they are for now.

05:33.340 --> 05:39.240
One thing about things like these handles here I'm going to delete these two for now.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.290
And just use the map one of them.

05:42.620 --> 05:47.790
And once this is U-V mapped then I'll duplicate it for all the others.

05:47.870 --> 05:55.450
And each of the duplicate U-V islands in the U-V map will be underneath the original.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.480
So they'll all be in one place now.

05:58.490 --> 06:03.620
They'll all have the same texture on them because of that but I don't think that will be a problem since

06:03.620 --> 06:05.870
they're so small in the scene.

06:05.930 --> 06:10.550
I could also do that with these doors but I don't think I want to.

06:10.550 --> 06:14.330
I would like these to have some grunge on them.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.550
That is a little bit differentiated.

06:16.550 --> 06:21.020
I don't want them to all look the same so I don't think I'm going to use the map.

06:21.030 --> 06:24.530
One set of doors and then duplicate them all around.

06:24.530 --> 06:27.350
I think that would look a little too repetitive.

06:27.350 --> 06:33.110
So having said that let's go ahead and begin I think for ease of use.

06:33.110 --> 06:40.400
I'm going to go ahead and try and get all of these in a different layer simply so it'll be a little

06:40.400 --> 06:41.840
bit easier to work with.

06:41.840 --> 06:53.340
I'll hit him and four and get these things over to the fourth layer him for get that one over there.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.890
And then all of these as well I think so.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.630
Grab them all.

07:02.540 --> 07:06.710
And hit them and for one more there we go.

07:06.710 --> 07:10.690
All right let's go over here and work on this.

07:10.710 --> 07:20.240
I will go ahead and go to my U-V editing view my U.V. screen lay out and here I'll begin adding seams

07:20.780 --> 07:22.310
for the U-V map.

07:22.310 --> 07:27.950
Now for these here let's go ahead and tab into edit mode and take a look at these.

07:28.100 --> 07:33.430
Do you think I can just hit you and unwrap and that will just work.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.850
Let's see you and unwrap.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.770
No it doesn't look like it will.

07:38.780 --> 07:48.620
However I can apply my rotation control a scuse me my scale and then tab back into edit mode and hit

07:48.620 --> 07:51.710
you and unwrap and see how that works.

07:51.740 --> 07:59.230
That's not too bad although it's pulling quite a lot around the corners so to alleviate that.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.860
I think what we need to do is add some seams here on each of the corners.

08:04.010 --> 08:10.720
So I'll go through and do that and go ahead and mark the seams with control.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.680
He and Mark seem and I'll mark these as well.

08:17.330 --> 08:23.600
All right so now I'll choose these again you and wrap and that looks a little better.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.560
So let's go through and do that again.

08:27.590 --> 08:35.250
Now I could just duplicate this again but it's not too big of a hassle to just mark these seams.

08:35.650 --> 08:40.660
Go ahead and do that all select all of these and unwrap those.

08:40.660 --> 08:49.000
Now you can tell because these are square here like the cubit was when it was first created that the

08:49.000 --> 08:57.250
scale hasn't been applied so I'll go ahead and apply the scale you and unwrap and that looks a lot better.

08:57.250 --> 08:57.560
All right.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.550
Let's keep going.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.850
I'll go ahead and do these other doors in the same way.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.970
All right so now we have the cabinet doors you have the map.

09:09.980 --> 09:13.700
Let's go ahead and work on the cabinets.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.170
The cases here.

09:16.180 --> 09:23.800
Same process all go through and just mark the seams around the edges here and since we don't have a

09:23.800 --> 09:27.300
back to them it's going to be a lot easier to work with.

09:27.760 --> 09:35.710
And I will of course make sure that the scale is applied and unwrap that that looks good and I'll go

09:35.710 --> 09:38.110
through and do that to all the others as well.

09:41.590 --> 09:44.080
All right so I've got everything on the top.

09:44.080 --> 09:50.320
U.V. mapped all go down and do the bottom part of the cabinets down here.

09:50.470 --> 09:57.910
If we take a look at this particular piece the countertop I'm the press shift H and tab into edit mode

09:58.480 --> 10:05.090
and for this I'm going to go ahead and split out this bottom piece.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.920
Go ahead and Marcus seem right down here.

10:09.450 --> 10:18.810
So that'll split out on its own and then go through and just mark the seams here.

10:19.040 --> 10:24.400
And remember that there is no face back here so if I select everything.

10:24.800 --> 10:32.360
Oh well let's go and apply our scale select everything and you and unwraps So there are the components

10:32.360 --> 10:33.330
of that.

10:33.830 --> 10:42.080
And it's the U-V island that has the wings on it here that is the top so we know which one is the top

10:42.080 --> 10:44.960
and which one is the bottom.

10:44.960 --> 10:50.590
So now it's just a matter of going through and doing the same thing for all the rest of the pieces.

10:50.990 --> 10:57.740
And then once we're done with all that we'll take a look at getting all the islands into the zero to

10:57.740 --> 11:01.280
one space here like we did before.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.720
All right I've got each one of these pieces you've mapped now

11:08.270 --> 11:14.000
here and now when I want to do is go ahead and combine all of these into one object.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.610
I'm just going to select everything and then I'm going to press control J.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.750
And then I will

11:24.270 --> 11:26.070
tab into edit mode.

11:26.190 --> 11:30.540
I'm going to go ahead and select everything and press you and unwrap.
