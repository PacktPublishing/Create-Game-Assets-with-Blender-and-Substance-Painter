WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:03.530
Well let's continue working on the television here.

00:03.680 --> 00:11.360
I think for the screen of the TV that old tube screen I think I'm going to use something like a sphere

00:11.720 --> 00:13.730
to get that rounded shape.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.080
Let's try it.

00:15.080 --> 00:24.350
I'm going to create a U-V sphere and take the segments down to maybe I don't know 16 I have a 12 and

00:24.500 --> 00:31.910
8 rings and I want to take away half of the sphere so I'm going to hit the three key the five key to

00:31.910 --> 00:40.450
go to orthographic alt tab into that mode and hit the Z key and also switch over to face mode.

00:40.870 --> 00:48.470
And now I'll hit the B key to turn on the border select tool and I'll just click and drag the faces

00:48.470 --> 00:54.080
back here at the back of the sphere and hit X and delete faces.

00:54.080 --> 01:01.190
Now I'm going to tab back into object mode and scale on the y axis with X and Y and kind of flatten

01:01.190 --> 01:06.290
this up a bit so it's more like the screen here and we go.

01:06.710 --> 01:13.190
And then if I hit the one key I'm going to tab into edit mode again and this time I'm going to border

01:13.190 --> 01:21.470
select the faces right up at the top and hit X and delete faces and border select the these down here

01:21.470 --> 01:26.120
at the bottom like this x and faces.

01:26.540 --> 01:33.050
And I may even want these other this other row of faces deleted as well but let me take a look at it

01:33.080 --> 01:34.870
and see what I think here.

01:34.880 --> 01:44.780
So let's move this into place and let's scale it down a bit so it kind of fits around here and yeah

01:44.810 --> 01:53.420
it almost looks like I don't need these top faces here so I'll go ahead and select this with the b key.

01:53.430 --> 01:59.210
Hit B again and select those and hit X and faces again.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.630
Now let's take a look at this.

02:01.730 --> 02:09.610
If I bring this object forward a bit here in the y axis I can kind of fit it right up against their.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.570
That looks pretty good.

02:10.570 --> 02:16.000
I'm gonna hit the five key again to go back to perspective view I just like to work in perspective view

02:16.000 --> 02:18.130
a little better I don't know why.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.620
And then I'm going to come up here to the Tools tab and click the smooth shading and there we go that

02:23.620 --> 02:25.440
kind of smooths it up.

02:25.450 --> 02:32.530
So now we have that kind of curved television tube there and you can of course scale it however you

02:32.530 --> 02:35.030
want to get more or less of a curve.

02:35.050 --> 02:37.230
But I think I'm going to go with that for now.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.330
Now let's work on the knobs over here.

02:41.330 --> 02:48.170
So these little guys right here I don't think they need to be that intricate but we can at least kind

02:48.170 --> 02:49.500
of hint at it.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.190
We're going to need a plate here this kind of just metal plate.

02:53.210 --> 03:01.670
I'll go ahead and add one here maybe I'll select this face press shift s and move the cursor to the

03:01.670 --> 03:09.700
selected face and then from that point I'll go ahead and create a cube right here.

03:09.860 --> 03:18.170
Little big and that's ok we'll scale it down a bit maybe take away that face at the back with X and

03:18.260 --> 03:23.450
faces and then we can kind of scale this in the y with X and Y and scale that.

03:23.450 --> 03:26.850
So it's a little flatter and maybe move that into place.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.230
Now let's see if that fits.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.830
And that's not too bad it could probably come down a bit more like that.

03:35.790 --> 03:40.380
And we go and let's put that up here in place.

03:40.450 --> 03:40.860
All right.

03:40.870 --> 03:50.080
So we have that there's also another plate right down here and I'm going to put that Zenith logo on

03:50.080 --> 03:57.130
this one down here I think and leave this one up here blank because I don't really have a texture for

03:57.130 --> 03:57.820
this.

03:57.820 --> 04:03.900
So I'm going to go ahead and just put it down here so I'll just duplicate this shift D.

04:03.910 --> 04:13.180
Hit the Z key and move this down here and maybe kind of collapse just a little bit like that.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.610
All right so we have those in place.

04:16.660 --> 04:21.310
What else do we need to do we need to do the legs let's do those for these.

04:21.310 --> 04:27.900
Now these are kind of square issue it looks like so maybe a cube.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.090
Let's try that.

04:30.180 --> 04:36.960
Put the cursor back into the center of the grid with shift C and I'll come over here the Create tab

04:36.960 --> 04:44.420
and click cube and let's scale this down quite a bit scale this up in the Z.

04:45.090 --> 04:46.960
Let's try and put it in place.

04:47.010 --> 04:51.360
I'll hit the three key five key z key.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.250
And now here we go.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.110
We need to try and figure out how tall this is going to be.

04:57.220 --> 05:04.720
So let's put this up here up front and that looks to me about the right size for the legs so let's bring

05:04.720 --> 05:06.800
the whole TV down a bit.

05:07.150 --> 05:09.280
Something like that.

05:09.590 --> 05:17.300
Maybe I can tab into edit mode select that face at the bottom and press S and scale that in a bit so

05:17.300 --> 05:20.630
it's a little bit narrower at the bottom.

05:20.810 --> 05:26.870
Come over to the front view and let's move it into place here.

05:26.870 --> 05:32.900
And then what we can do is with this face still selected I'll just drag it over a bit kind of give us

05:32.900 --> 05:35.910
that angled look there.

05:36.010 --> 05:36.390
All right.

05:36.390 --> 05:37.090
That looks pretty good.

05:37.090 --> 05:40.380
Now we don't need the top in the bottom faces here.

05:40.400 --> 05:50.060
Do we so I'll select those two and hit X and faces and then I'll hit the 7 key and press shift D and

05:50.060 --> 05:59.520
move that here in the y axis like that like these two shift D and X and move these over here.

05:59.620 --> 06:04.850
And now what I can do is I can spin this all the way around with these two selected.

06:04.990 --> 06:09.680
I could hit our 180 and that'll spin them all the way around.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.530
All right so now let's take a look at it.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.700
Hit that five key.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.140
There we go.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.560
So now let's work on these knobs here.

06:20.590 --> 06:27.190
I'll select this piece tab into Edit Mode shift s cursor to selected.

06:27.190 --> 06:31.370
And now I can create a cylinder here.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.310
Let's reduce the number of faces to maybe 12.

06:36.310 --> 06:37.790
Let's try that.

06:37.840 --> 06:48.160
Remove any cap fill here so choose nothing and I'll rotate around the x axis with our x 9 0 and we go

06:49.040 --> 06:55.450
and let's scale this down and put it in place X Y.

06:55.620 --> 06:56.400
And here we go.

06:56.400 --> 07:08.750
So this let's say is going to be this one right over here so maybe I can place it like this.

07:08.950 --> 07:14.170
Let me go to my front view and orthographic and wireframe and maybe I can place it a little better like

07:14.170 --> 07:17.840
this something like that.

07:17.860 --> 07:26.300
Let's say I'll zoom in with period key and now let's try and create something that looks like this.

07:26.300 --> 07:31.280
I don't think I need all of this geometry in here but we need something that kind of hints at it.

07:31.530 --> 07:37.530
So I'll tab into edit mode and maybe go to edge mode and select this edge and I'm going to move this

07:37.530 --> 07:42.030
down here like this for say this part right here.

07:43.170 --> 07:52.880
Hit the scale in a bit and move it out maybe scale that in a little more and let's go ahead and see

07:52.910 --> 08:01.590
and why and move that straight out it's hit extrude and scale straight out now.

08:01.980 --> 08:05.790
And what I'll do is go ahead and bring this forward with e y.

08:07.700 --> 08:14.720
And yeah let's go ahead and hit E and scale this all the way in and then I'll just kind of punch this

08:14.720 --> 08:16.330
out just a little bit.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.610
And scale this in like this.

08:20.610 --> 08:25.840
Now I'll go ahead and press alt M and choose merge to center.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.990
So there we go.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.350
So it's not quite what we see here but I think it kind of hints at it we can move this back and place

08:34.350 --> 08:36.600
it right in here.

08:36.630 --> 08:37.500
All right.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.000
So there's that.

08:39.090 --> 08:47.950
We'll go ahead and take that and duplicate it with shift D and move that right down here like that.

08:47.990 --> 08:53.940
I'll go and press shift C to move the cursor down to the center of the grid and Z to go back to shaded

08:53.940 --> 08:57.560
view and 5 for perspective.

08:57.570 --> 09:03.740
All right so now we have our TV and see is there anything else we need to put on here.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.180
I feel like there's kind of a hard edge around here.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.700
I wonder if there's anything I can do about that.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.960
Perhaps I could choose these faces here and flatten them.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.760
Let's try that.

09:13.770 --> 09:19.550
If I go to shading Uvas and hit flat see what happens there.

09:20.010 --> 09:25.020
Yes see that gives it a little more of an edge around there kind of like this.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.450
I think that'll work.

09:26.910 --> 09:32.430
Let's now work on U-V mapping it and getting it ready to be textured.

09:32.430 --> 09:41.090
Now I know that in this scene I am never going to see the back of this TV or the bottom of this TV.

09:41.130 --> 09:46.440
I know that because this is my project and I get to say how it's going to be.

09:46.440 --> 09:53.550
Now if you're working on a project in a team environment or a studio you may not have this kind of luxury

09:53.550 --> 10:00.600
and that's fine but I know I'm never going to see the back of this tv and I'm never gonna see the bottom

10:00.600 --> 10:09.990
of the TV so I'm going to hit the C key and select these faces back here and just get rid of them because

10:10.080 --> 10:16.430
I know I don't need them and I don't want them in my scene and I don't want to have to use them.

10:16.510 --> 10:24.540
Honestly so I'll grab all of these and get rid of them.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.120
So there we go.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.540
There is what we need to U-V map.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.860
I like that I like that it's a little simpler.

10:32.870 --> 10:34.280
All right so let's think about this.

10:34.280 --> 10:40.820
I'm going to go to my U-V editing screen lay out I'm going to hit the period key to zoom into this area

10:40.820 --> 10:42.480
here.

10:42.740 --> 10:48.140
I think I'm going to wait to combine all of these objects until after I view the map.

10:48.140 --> 10:53.900
Them are U-V mapped them one at a time as individual objects and I think that's sometimes a little bit

10:53.900 --> 10:55.310
easier.

10:55.370 --> 11:01.630
I don't want my U-V test view here so I'm going to click the X right here to get rid of that for now.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.550
So let's let's begin.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.180
I'm going to select that TV screen I'll press shift.

11:09.220 --> 11:09.810
H.

11:09.850 --> 11:11.300
And there it is.

11:11.320 --> 11:17.190
So that looks like it's going to be pretty easy to U-V map Alt-Tab into edit mode.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.380
Hit the A key you and unwrap.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.830
Now it's looking a little curved here.

11:23.920 --> 11:32.150
I think we can maybe apply our transforms and see how that looks saw press control a and hit scale.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.760
I'll tab into edit mode and hit you and unwrap and.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.370
Yeah that looks a little better now.

11:38.860 --> 11:45.190
Now I have this stretch feature turned on just so I can see the amount of stretching here and it looks

11:45.550 --> 11:49.830
totally blue which means no stretching so that's good.

11:49.870 --> 11:56.810
I'll go back to object mode press alt h to bring everything else back let's work on just the cabinet

11:56.810 --> 11:58.940
now I'll select that press shift.

11:58.970 --> 11:59.900
H.

12:00.050 --> 12:07.400
And here we are with just the cabinet tab into edit mode and let's see if we can split this out in a

12:07.400 --> 12:09.340
reasonable way here.

12:09.920 --> 12:16.760
I think maybe I'll press alt and click an edge here let me get into edge mode so I'll press alt and

12:16.760 --> 12:24.140
click this edge now that selects that entire edge all the way around I'll go ahead and add a seam there.

12:24.440 --> 12:29.200
Mark seen let's go ahead and add a seam here.

12:29.980 --> 12:36.490
And here as well control e Mark seam and that'll break those out.

12:36.490 --> 12:43.330
Now I'm going to want to use this area to U-V map that speaker's screen so I better split this out as

12:43.330 --> 12:44.230
well.

12:44.370 --> 12:47.310
I'll press alt and click and that doesn't much help.

12:47.320 --> 12:57.200
I'll just press shift and select these edges here and Marcuse seem well also split out this interior

12:57.200 --> 12:58.160
piece here too.

12:58.170 --> 13:08.570
I'll press alt and click and shift and allt see if I can get these selected all the way around here.

13:10.820 --> 13:15.050
Like this and this let's go and break this out.

13:16.360 --> 13:25.380
Larc seem all right let's see how we did Alt-Tab into object mode press control a and choose scale.

13:25.810 --> 13:28.810
And now let's go into edit mode.

13:28.820 --> 13:33.710
Hit you and unwrap and I don't like this whatever that is.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.750
What is that.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.710
That's kind of gross.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.650
Let's take a look at that.

13:37.660 --> 13:45.160
I want to turn this on so that I can select a face and hit the period key over here and zoom in and

13:45.160 --> 13:47.510
see what that is.

13:47.680 --> 13:56.390
Let's select face mode here and hit El hover over face and hit Al and that'll like that whole thing.

13:56.410 --> 13:59.190
That's this whole piece here.

13:59.320 --> 14:06.680
So we should probably split this up as well to break it apart into its individual edges here.

14:06.730 --> 14:14.380
So let me let's take this ledge here and here.

14:15.110 --> 14:23.980
And all the way around to here and let's mark a seam there and let's do that for all of the other parts

14:24.310 --> 14:26.770
or sides as well.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.390
I'll go ahead and slide this and these edges

14:32.040 --> 14:33.860
and let's do the same for down here.

14:38.630 --> 14:40.780
All right with those seams.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.800
Mark let's go and select everything again.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.370
Hit you and unwrap and see how we did.

14:45.650 --> 14:49.330
Yeah that's a little better see how it's laying these out flat.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.450
Now I think that'll work a little bit better.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.930
Not going to hit Control up arrow and take a look at this full screen.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.650
One thing I'm not too sure about.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.460
Let me turn this part off here.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.980
If I select this piece right here let's move that out and take a look at this.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.340
I'm not real wild about all of this.

15:10.580 --> 15:17.930
I think because I'm going to be laying down kind of a woodgrain veneer on this I'd like to have this

15:17.930 --> 15:23.540
piece split out so I can arrange it in line with the woodgrain as well.

15:23.540 --> 15:30.320
So let me go back to my object here and it's this one here isn't it.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.320
So I'll select this edge right here.

15:35.400 --> 15:40.220
And this edge and mark a seam and I'll do this down on the bottom as well.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.990
All right let's try one more time.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.910
Hey you to unwrap.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.570
And here we go.

15:50.430 --> 15:51.720
Let's see how we did here.

15:51.720 --> 15:51.990
Yeah.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.850
I think that works a little bit better.

15:53.850 --> 16:00.120
Let me hit Control up arrow here and yeah I think we're going to be able to align the woodgrain a little

16:00.120 --> 16:01.550
bit better with this.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.240
That's good.

16:02.430 --> 16:07.810
I'll work on aligning these once we get everything all combined together again.

16:07.830 --> 16:14.190
So let's go back and let's try the next part I'll press alt H.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.460
And what else do you want to do.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.660
Well how about this piece here.

16:18.660 --> 16:19.840
Let's try this.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.680
I'll press shift H.

16:21.990 --> 16:24.690
And let's just try it like this.

16:24.690 --> 16:32.460
Why not a press control a and hit the scale and then I'll tab into edit mode and hit the A key and let's

16:32.460 --> 16:35.790
just try you and unwrap.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.910
What do you think.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.260
Not great but not bad.

16:41.290 --> 16:44.910
Now this is going to be all one just solid material.

16:44.920 --> 16:52.330
We're not going to be putting any woodgrain or text or anything that we can really tell that it's stretched.

16:52.330 --> 16:58.140
So since it's just going to be all one material I think I'm going to leave it and give it a try.

16:58.210 --> 17:06.160
You can see all the stretching here but a lot of that is what's going on back here inside the TV.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.180
I mean this part here is going to be pretty well hidden.

17:09.190 --> 17:12.490
So let's let's not worry too much about this.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.740
I think we'll be OK.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.500
Now let's let's work on these pieces here.

17:18.210 --> 17:22.870
I'll just select it hit you and unwrap and that's really ugly.

17:22.870 --> 17:27.990
Let's try and apply our scale and try again you and unwrap.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.950
That's better.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.280
Yeah I don't mind.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.940
Once again the stretching around the edge because it's going to be all one material.

17:36.040 --> 17:43.540
Let's try this one control a scale tab into edit mode and you and unwrap.

17:43.690 --> 17:48.460
That's not too bad either although this one is going to have a texture on it.

17:48.610 --> 17:55.330
Maybe I can just go ahead and select these edges here just to see if it's going to help it a bit.

17:56.430 --> 18:00.090
Let me select these edges around the corners.

18:00.300 --> 18:08.220
Mark seems here and recall that there is no face on the back of this so it's just a one sided object

18:08.220 --> 18:11.710
here which is good when we're U-V mapping.

18:11.710 --> 18:17.250
I'll go ahead and select everything and you and unwrap and that allows that to break apart a little

18:17.250 --> 18:18.110
easier.

18:18.150 --> 18:20.340
That looks a little better.

18:20.600 --> 18:20.850
All right.

18:20.850 --> 18:28.780
Now this part right in here we need to think about here so where is this face right here.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.790
There it is.

18:29.860 --> 18:35.320
We're going to have to remember and know where that is because we're going to put a texture on that

18:35.320 --> 18:37.010
as well.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.980
Let's do one of these.

18:39.010 --> 18:47.420
I'm going to press shift h zoom in with the period key and for this we could probably just create seams

18:47.470 --> 18:50.250
along here.

18:51.810 --> 18:57.440
Here here and I'm going to put seams here and one there.

18:57.480 --> 19:06.540
So we've kind of got seams breaking out the cylindrical parts and keeping the flat parts.

19:06.570 --> 19:07.590
This part here.

19:07.620 --> 19:11.480
Go ahead and split that out too just to see how we do there.

19:11.490 --> 19:11.970
All right.

19:12.210 --> 19:16.020
Let's try it control a and scale.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.470
Select everything you and enwrap.

19:18.930 --> 19:20.690
Yeah that's not too bad.

19:20.730 --> 19:28.500
That breaks it out because we're going to put a black kind of color here on that top part right there.

19:28.500 --> 19:28.920
All right.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.070
That's not too bad.

19:30.090 --> 19:32.990
Now that is U-V mapped.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.460
I'm not going to do the other one.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.370
I'm just going to duplicate it.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.560
So I don't need this.

19:38.880 --> 19:43.300
Get rid of that take this one and just duplicate it.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.720
Now that it's been U-V mapped.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.700
There we go.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.350
All right.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.420
I think oh we need the legs right.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.440
Let's do those.

19:55.440 --> 20:00.800
I will go ahead and make those all one object with control.

20:02.450 --> 20:08.260
And now if I hit shift 8 you will isolate those Alt-Tab and edit mode.

20:08.270 --> 20:15.630
And once again since these do not have any tops or bottoms I can go into edge mode and just select the

20:15.630 --> 20:29.450
center edges this and Mark seem there I should probably apply to transference for the scale.

20:29.510 --> 20:32.550
A You and enwrap good.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.010
Yeah that looks good.

20:34.000 --> 20:34.620
OK.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.180
Now Allt H.

20:38.200 --> 20:48.470
Bring everything back select everything with the eight key control J to make it all one object tab into

20:48.470 --> 20:50.290
edit mode select everything.

20:50.300 --> 20:59.380
And now over here in the U-V map I'll hit the A key just like everything press control a press control

20:59.410 --> 21:01.060
p.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.710
And now we have everything in the map.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.840
Let's see how we did.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.860
I'll hit Control up arrow and let's see how we did.

21:08.860 --> 21:13.740
I'd kind of like to rotate this so I'm going to click this rotate.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.890
Here we go.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.680
Hit control up arrow again.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.040
All right.

21:19.050 --> 21:24.370
So now we've got things pretty well placed.

21:24.430 --> 21:29.540
I can see this is the top of the television.

21:29.670 --> 21:36.150
These are the sides I believe they should probably be in line with each other.

21:36.450 --> 21:39.510
Here's all the edges they're pretty well in line with each other.

21:39.510 --> 21:45.340
Let me just rotate this one I'll press are 9:0 and see how that works.

21:45.450 --> 21:49.100
Let me scale it down just a hair so it'll fit in there.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.920
And here we go.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.380
So I think that looks pretty good.

21:52.380 --> 21:56.820
I think all of the woodgrain now is going this way.

21:57.720 --> 22:03.240
We've got our TV screen and our frame around the screen here.

22:03.660 --> 22:10.070
This is the polygon we want to lay that Speaker texture down onto.

22:10.290 --> 22:14.250
And this is the plate that we want to put the zenith thing onto.

22:14.250 --> 22:19.670
Now I can scale that up just a little bit give it a little more breathing room.

22:19.670 --> 22:22.580
There it doesn't need to be quite that small.

22:22.580 --> 22:23.950
That could help there.

22:24.930 --> 22:32.430
Give that a little bit more detail there are these here these could turn the other way couldn't they.

22:32.430 --> 22:33.130
Let's try that.

22:33.150 --> 22:39.620
Our 9:0 here and let's see we'll need to fit that in somewhere.

22:39.630 --> 22:42.320
This could turn the other way.

22:42.530 --> 22:46.110
I'll need to fit that in here in just a minute.

22:46.110 --> 22:55.740
And all of this is all one piece or all one texture all of this needs to be together let's grab all

22:55.740 --> 23:01.740
of this and move this out so we can separate that out.

23:02.370 --> 23:04.070
Well go ahead and move these down here.

23:04.070 --> 23:06.580
These aren't really prominent in the television.

23:06.580 --> 23:13.910
I don't think and scale them back up a bit and then I'll take this guy and allow him to breathe a little

23:13.910 --> 23:18.920
bit more since we're going to have actual texture on that.

23:18.930 --> 23:19.840
There we go.

23:20.690 --> 23:21.020
All right.

23:21.030 --> 23:28.980
So now I've got it arranged I think to maximize this part and this part that are going to actually accept

23:28.990 --> 23:35.790
the texture and then all of these pieces here are going to have woodgrain on them and they're all going

23:35.790 --> 23:38.270
in generally the same direction.

23:38.310 --> 23:42.900
So let's see how this works in the next video we'll start working on the textures.
