WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:07.380
With our TV U-V map let's go ahead and export out the map so we can take it into Photoshop and do a

00:07.380 --> 00:13.740
little texturing tab into edit mode and select everything and there's our map and I'll go ahead.

00:13.740 --> 00:23.190
Go to movies export U-V lay out or go to my textures folder and I'll create a new folder here and I'll

00:23.190 --> 00:31.300
call it TV and in here I'll just I'll just call this TV underscore Uvas.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.750
Now down here in the size.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.370
We've currently got 10:24.

00:35.370 --> 00:41.370
I'm going to go ahead and export it out as 2048 and if I need to I can always save it out of Photoshop

00:41.370 --> 00:44.660
at a smaller resolution like 10:24 or 5:12.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.640
But for now I'll go ahead and use 2048.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.750
So I have more resolution to work with.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.310
While I do the texturing.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.350
All right so I'll export these out.

00:54.460 --> 00:55.600
And there we go.

00:55.990 --> 01:01.650
Let's go take a look at them in Photoshop here in Photoshop I've got my U-V map pulled up.

01:01.660 --> 01:10.750
I will go ahead and change this top layer to you these call it Uvas and I need to find that woodgrain

01:10.750 --> 01:16.910
texture that kind of dark wood grain veneer that we saw in that reference image.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.390
In fact why don't we pull that up.

01:18.390 --> 01:24.210
I'm going to open this up and let's find the reference image of that TV.

01:24.340 --> 01:29.830
And while we're here we can go ahead and open up these textures too that we're going to use on the texture

01:29.830 --> 01:31.780
map as well.

01:31.780 --> 01:32.940
Open that.

01:33.730 --> 01:40.160
And here is that TV so I'm looking for this kind of fairly dark wood grain veneer.

01:40.570 --> 01:48.040
So here it textures dotcom I'm going to go ahead and use this and look for some sort of a dark wood

01:48.680 --> 01:51.070
look for only seamless.

01:51.130 --> 01:55.310
This is nice but the problem is it's it's a floor.

01:55.470 --> 02:02.670
It's got the breaks in it as if it's got wood floorboards so I don't want that.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.820
This is kind of nice here.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.490
Let me take a look at that.

02:06.890 --> 02:07.150
Yeah.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.170
I think maybe I'll go with this would find 11.

02:11.270 --> 02:15.930
So I'll download it and take it into Photoshop here in Photoshop.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.610
I'll go ahead and select it.

02:17.690 --> 02:24.600
I can go to select and all select all here and then I can go to Edit and copy right here.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.930
Controlled or command see.

02:27.050 --> 02:34.660
And I'll go back to my movies and I'll paste it here with control or command the.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.330
So here we go.

02:35.330 --> 02:40.070
I'll drag it down below the Uvas And let's start putting this in place.

02:40.340 --> 02:43.610
I'll hold the shift key and scale it down and I'll get it.

02:43.610 --> 02:49.710
So it's about the size of one of these side panels here something like that.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.270
I think that'd work pretty well.

02:51.290 --> 02:53.570
Hit the Z key and zoom in.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.850
Yeah I think this could work.

02:56.870 --> 03:00.200
Let's go ahead and give this a try.

03:00.200 --> 03:07.510
I'm going to press alt shift and drag this down and do that.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.960
Probably just one more time here.

03:09.990 --> 03:15.900
And let's also put this over this part right here I'll press alt to copy it and drag it and move it

03:15.900 --> 03:21.930
right over here and then I'll duplicate it again and put it right there.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.500
All right.

03:24.390 --> 03:30.530
So I'm going to need to clean this up a bit because it's going way over into the other U-V islands.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.030
I'll press em.

03:32.900 --> 03:43.580
And I will go ahead and drag out an area to delete and when we go we can also extend this woodgrain

03:43.610 --> 03:45.560
to these areas as well.

03:45.560 --> 03:52.310
So we've got we placed these U-V islands so they would go in line with the grain.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.760
So let's go ahead and do that.

03:54.860 --> 03:59.600
I'll just hit alt and click and drag this.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.990
And once again alt and shift and click and drag and we go.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.920
And then one more right down here like that.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.020
OK so now we need to clean this up.

04:13.230 --> 04:20.310
What we can do is go ahead and combine all these layers together with shift click all of these press

04:20.310 --> 04:24.500
control or command E and combine those all together.

04:24.690 --> 04:34.470
I'll now use that magic wand tool over here to select everything around all the movies can track them

04:34.470 --> 04:42.290
back just a bit contract maybe two frames and then I'll select the wood layer and delete all of that

04:42.300 --> 04:45.140
so that cleans that up now.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.570
It didn't clean everything up quite the way we want.

04:48.570 --> 04:55.010
Because this is still covered so well like that and delete those as well.

04:55.010 --> 04:56.110
All right.

04:56.510 --> 05:04.310
Now we want to include the little legs down here so I'll just with the wood lair select it out I'll

05:04.310 --> 05:13.820
just click and drag in here and press control C and control V and that will give me a new area that

05:13.820 --> 05:22.080
I can drag around and this time I need to turn the woodgrain down some like that just so we can cover

05:22.080 --> 05:24.460
this area right here.

05:24.910 --> 05:25.840
That will work.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.440
I'll go ahead and combine those back and I'll call that wood.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.970
And there we go.

05:33.090 --> 05:37.600
Now of course this area doesn't need wood on it and now does it.

05:37.620 --> 05:42.080
We need to clean that off because that's going to be our speaker fabric.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.640
We want that.

05:43.710 --> 05:44.500
All right.

05:44.820 --> 05:48.000
So let's go ahead and grab that speaker fabric where is that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.080
Here it is.

05:49.350 --> 05:55.040
Let's grab this all select all and copy and let's paste this right in here.

05:56.350 --> 05:59.830
Now I'll move it up into here.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.670
Shrink it down a bit and then duplicate it as well.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.640
Let's see if we can place that Zenith logo on our plate.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.580
Here I'll come back over to the zenith nameplate.

06:11.930 --> 06:14.650
And this is pretty small.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.710
I think he'll work.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.570
Let's give it a try.

06:17.570 --> 06:23.940
I'm going to press the key and drag select around this try and get it pretty tight.

06:25.300 --> 06:30.570
It's a little bit off angle or a little bit turn so I want to have to adjust that.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.290
But let's go and give this a try.

06:32.290 --> 06:40.540
I'm going to press controller and see to copy and let's come back over here and I'll paste this here.

06:40.630 --> 06:49.090
Now I'll move that up in this area and let's see if we can use the warp or distort tools to get this

06:49.150 --> 06:55.220
the right size and so it isn't quite so angled so I need to turn it a bit.

06:55.220 --> 07:01.140
Let me just turn it just a hair to get it so it's parallel with the top there.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.640
Now I need to get these bottom corners in line so to stretch that down.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.620
But we're going to need to pull these a bit.

07:07.880 --> 07:18.210
So let's go up here to edit transform and let's try war plus see if this will help me grab this and

07:18.210 --> 07:19.590
drag it in.

07:21.050 --> 07:25.220
That edge right there and maybe grab this and yeah there we go.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.030
Let me grab this and move it in.

07:30.210 --> 07:34.670
Maybe move that this looks OK I think.

07:35.710 --> 07:37.560
Something like that.

07:37.600 --> 07:44.770
So let me clean up the edges here with the key and just drag a key out here to try and clean up these

07:44.890 --> 07:47.730
edges and delete those.

07:48.040 --> 07:48.970
And I'll do the same.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.410
All the way around.

07:51.530 --> 07:57.200
Now let's go ahead and take this color here and I'm going to maybe use this color to put around the

07:57.200 --> 08:01.580
edges I kind of like this worn gold material here.

08:01.730 --> 08:09.740
So I press the I key to grab that color and I'll press the key and then drag a mark key say right in

08:09.740 --> 08:13.890
here and go to the paint tool.

08:13.940 --> 08:20.870
We create a new lair and drag it underneath that and we go and I'll just

08:23.590 --> 08:27.000
add that color underneath it like that.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.420
And I can do the same thing over here.

08:30.360 --> 08:38.380
Him in drag and I'll add that color again with the G key or the paint bucket down there.

08:38.550 --> 08:40.000
Same thing over here.

08:41.550 --> 08:44.080
So now we've got that done.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.280
We've got our fabric in place.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.430
We need to think about the color of these knobs.

08:51.660 --> 09:00.280
The frame around the tube that panel I think those all can be about the same color what color should

09:00.280 --> 09:01.380
they be.

09:01.780 --> 09:09.070
Well maybe like a silver color because if we go over here to that TV image they're all about the same

09:09.070 --> 09:10.550
color.

09:10.570 --> 09:14.960
In fact we could even hit the Ickey and sample a color here.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.320
Give this a try.

09:18.010 --> 09:25.060
Let's try something like that and let's come back over here and now I'll just create a new layer for

09:25.060 --> 09:25.860
these.

09:25.990 --> 09:30.280
Hit the M key and I'll just Marki around these.

09:30.340 --> 09:38.980
Hit the G key and fill it seems a little too dark let's lighten that up just a bit and a little bit

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
more gray.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.080
And we go.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.920
I think that should work.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.620
Let's do this one over here.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.530
And then this frame here as well.

09:52.600 --> 09:59.300
Drag a marquee like so and fill that.

09:59.390 --> 10:03.470
All right so now that to Blits see what we can.

10:03.510 --> 10:05.400
I like that greenish color here.

10:05.410 --> 10:10.160
Let's just grab that let's just yeah kind of like that.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.230
All right.

10:11.230 --> 10:20.310
And one last time let's grab let's create a new layer and go to our marquee tool and just drag and hit

10:20.330 --> 10:23.220
G and select that.

10:23.380 --> 10:30.490
All right before we clean it up and put a black background in it let's go ahead and export it out and

10:30.490 --> 10:32.630
test it to see how it looks.

10:32.680 --> 10:42.670
So I'll turn off the movies and I'll go to file an export Export as I go to export all and put that

10:42.670 --> 10:45.850
in my TV texture folder.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.570
I'll take out the movies and put an underscore see for color map.

10:50.570 --> 10:54.500
And now let's just take it into blender and take a look at it.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.340
So I'm going to need to create a new material here.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.380
I can do that over here in the Noad editor or over in the properties panel.

11:01.580 --> 11:09.300
Well just do it over here in the note editor this time and I'll just call it TV and list press shift

11:09.390 --> 11:12.630
a and go to texture and image texture.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.360
And now let's bring in that color map.

11:17.700 --> 11:25.040
Here we go and I'll switch from solid to text you viewport shading and there we go.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.630
Not too bad now.

11:27.650 --> 11:34.700
I think this panel here though should probably mirror the color pattern of this so maybe I'll want some

11:34.700 --> 11:36.980
of that and gold up in here.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.660
Let's come back to Photoshop.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.550
And for this panel this is it right here.

11:45.690 --> 11:51.510
We should probably try and take this color put it in here.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.620
And we need a little dirt here too.

11:56.630 --> 12:00.680
This has got a nice patina to it and I kind of want that over here.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.730
So we'll need a little grunge see what we have again.

12:04.850 --> 12:12.580
Yeah let me try this bring that in rabbit paste it

12:19.040 --> 12:30.120
and I'll change the blending mode to multiply let's say Yeah we go something like that and I'll reduce

12:30.120 --> 12:32.310
the size of it even more.

12:32.310 --> 12:37.950
So it's pretty small here.

12:37.950 --> 12:38.890
There we go.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.750
And maybe reduce the opacity just a bit.

12:43.880 --> 12:49.520
Here we go something like that so it kind of matches this a little bit.

12:49.590 --> 12:59.880
And what else did we say oh the knobs we want these little knobs to have black on them right here.

13:00.060 --> 13:09.960
And let's go ahead and take oh not a not a complete black but a pretty dark gray and lay that down right

13:09.960 --> 13:12.440
there.

13:12.500 --> 13:17.210
There are a couple of little housekeeping chores that we should do before we take this into unity.

13:17.210 --> 13:22.040
First of all I want to take this pivot point and move it down to the center of the grid here so I'll

13:22.040 --> 13:27.680
just come over here to the Tools panel set origin and origin the 3D cursor.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.250
There we go.

13:29.390 --> 13:33.160
The next thing I need to do is think about what kind of materials I want here.

13:33.500 --> 13:39.650
I'm going to set up the materials in unity but I need to break them out here in Blender before I export

13:39.650 --> 13:40.840
this.

13:40.850 --> 13:41.990
So let's think about this.

13:41.990 --> 13:46.910
First of all I guess we need a material for the wood veneer here.

13:47.980 --> 13:55.410
We need a material for this frame and the material for the frame may also be the material for the knobs

13:55.420 --> 13:57.640
here we may be able to use that.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.780
I think we need a material for the panels.

14:00.880 --> 14:06.490
They're going to be a little bit different shining us than probably anything else.

14:06.490 --> 14:11.650
And also the tube here I think we're going to want this to be fairly reflective in the scene so we'll

14:11.650 --> 14:13.940
probably need material for that.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.970
So we've got quite a few materials going on here in this one object.

14:17.980 --> 14:24.010
So what we'll do is we'll go ahead and set up the materials the way we did for the walls of the room.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.900
One object but multiple materials.

14:26.920 --> 14:38.200
So for the main one here let's call this TV slash wood because that's that wood veneer.

14:38.770 --> 14:47.020
Let's Tebb into edit mode and maybe I'll hover over the screen here and press the L key and for this

14:47.020 --> 14:56.290
let's create a new material slot let's call it let's call it TV screen.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.970
And let's assign that.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.260
There we go.

15:02.270 --> 15:12.120
Let's also do the frames so I'll hover over the frame and I'll also hover over these knobs here.

15:12.140 --> 15:19.700
Currently I'm selecting by seam or my selections are being delineated by scenes and I don't want that

15:20.090 --> 15:27.110
I want to just let's use material and that will allow me to select over the seams so I'll just press

15:27.110 --> 15:29.670
the L key and select these pieces.

15:29.730 --> 15:35.150
Let's with the new material slot in a new material Let's call this TV.

15:35.300 --> 15:39.750
I don't know frameless just call it TV frame and hit a sign.

15:39.980 --> 15:46.940
We're going to need materials for these panels so I'll de-select those and hover over this panel press

15:46.940 --> 15:50.120
the L key and this one and press the L key here.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.400
So we want the same material on these pieces.

15:53.540 --> 15:57.320
Create a new material slot and new material.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.910
TV What do you think we should call these.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.040
I don't know let's just call them panels.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.260
OK let's also do this piece here the fabric.

16:08.270 --> 16:13.290
That's just one face so I'm going to go to face mode and select that.

16:13.590 --> 16:15.010
I like that.

16:15.020 --> 16:21.590
This is going to be the fabric so I'll create a new material stot and a new material and call this TV

16:22.070 --> 16:25.540
fabric and assign that.

16:25.850 --> 16:33.750
Now look what I did I did not assign that material to these panels so I better go back and do that.

16:33.750 --> 16:41.460
Let me hover over and select those with the L key select the panel's material and click assign.

16:41.470 --> 16:42.580
All right.

16:42.880 --> 16:48.480
So now if I come up here to the TV would material and hit select.

16:48.490 --> 16:49.620
That's what I get.

16:49.780 --> 16:50.570
That's correct.

16:50.620 --> 16:51.650
OK.

16:52.060 --> 16:57.730
And I can de-select here and I can go through and just test each one of these.

16:57.750 --> 17:03.610
Now currently I have the TV frame including the TV screen and that isn't correct.

17:03.610 --> 17:04.120
Now is it.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.920
So if I choose the TV screen and I hit select I don't get anything.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.140
So that's a problem.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.140
What let's do is let's go back and select that screen.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.210
And with TV screen selected click a sign.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.970
Now let's test this again.

17:18.970 --> 17:23.340
I'll go to a TV frame hit select and that's what I should get.

17:23.350 --> 17:31.390
So you just sometimes need to go back and make sure that what you got is what you want.

17:31.410 --> 17:32.040
There we go.

17:32.080 --> 17:32.860
OK.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.600
So I think that works.

17:34.600 --> 17:40.060
We now have our materials in place we have our pivot point where we want it to be.

17:40.270 --> 17:43.840
I think we are ready to export this out to unity.
